  You can download the latest Message Analyzer from below website [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226)

## <a name="_Toc374100974"/>Network Setup

Run this test suite in a domain environment using either physical or virtual machines. This section describes the test environment using physical computers. 

For information about configuring a virtual machine, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/create-virtual-machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/create-virtual-machine). The configuration of virtual machines for use with this test suite is out of the scope of this guide. 

### <a name="_Toc374100975"/>Domain Environment

The domain environment requires interactions between the following computers and server roles. 

* The DCCA runs an implementation of the domain controller and certificate authority. The DCCA provides the domain environment for the testing, and also the functionality to authorize certificate which is used to identify server and client in device registration process.

* The ADFS runs the active directory federation services, which is a backend server used to generate real access token.

* The SUT runs an implementation of the web application proxy, which is being tested.

* The DRIVER runs the test cases by acting as a synthetic server which responses to the requests from the proxy, which is regarded as the client, to test the proxy’s behavior.

The following figure shows the domain environment.

![image3.png](./image/MS-ADFSPIP_ClientUserGuide/image3.png)

This following table shows the recommanded IP setting between the machine, all the computer set the static IP for IPV4 and can ping with other computer.

|  **Computer**|  **IP setting**| 
| -------------| ------------- |
| DCCA| IPv4: 192.168.1.1| 
| | DNS: 127.0.0.1| 
| ADFS| IPv4: 192.168.1.2| 
| | DNS: 192.168.1.1|

You can find the log files in the "TestResults" directory, a subdirectory of the test suite installation directory. The log files that contain test suite results use a  &#42; .trx file name, in which the asterisk (" &#42; ") character represents the user name, the protocol name, or both.

Additional log files are used for generating requirement coverage reports and diagnosing test issues. Their settings can be found in the  &#42; .ptfconfig or  &#42; .deployment.ptfconfig files. The file names, corresponding paths, and formats can be set in the Sinks node of the configuration file. 

The following instruction provides an example of how to cause log entries for the "Debug" logging sink not to be written into the MS-ADFSPIP_Log.txt file in the current directory:
 
 &#60; File id="Debug" directory=".\" file="MS-ADFSPIP_Log.txt" format="text"/ &#62; 

#### <a name="_Toc374100996"/>Manage the Generation of Log Files

The log files contain a range of information including, but not limited to, the following:

* Test computer client and server names

* Internet Protocol (IP) addresses

* User names and passwords

* Domain names and test domain names

* DHCP and DNS servers, pipes, and mail slots

* Security Identifiers (SIDs) 

* Globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) of domain controllers

* Port numbers

* User account settings associated with Windows Active Directory

* Name of sites which are present or nonexistent.

None of this information is sent to Microsoft. 

If you do not need the log files for debugging, you can delete them. You can also control the generation of all log files for the test suite, except for  &#42; .trx files. 

The following describes how to stop the generation of log files using the file name extensions of .txt and .xml. This process should be followed _before_ you run test cases in Visual Studio.

To prevent the generation of .txt and .xml type log files

Note 

This procedure assumes that the test suite was installed at the root directory **C:**. MS-ADFSPIP represents the protocol name.

* Open the MS-ADFSPIP_ClientTestSuite.ptfconfig file. You can find this configuration file at the path C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADFSPIP\Client-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Source\Client\TestCode\TestSuite. Or, if you use batch files to run your test cases, you can find this file at C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADFSPIP\Client-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Bin.

* Locate the Sinks node and comment out all the entries.

* Locate the Profile node and comment out all the entries.

* Locate the Profile node and add the following entries:

	&#60; Rule kind="CheckSucceeded" sink="Console" delete="false" / &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Checkpoint" sink="Console" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Comment" sink="Console" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Debug" sink="Console" delete="false" / &#62; 
	
	&#60; !-- Show for XML log -- &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="CheckSucceeded" sink="XMLLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Comment" sink="XMLLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Checkpoint" sink="XMLLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Debug" sink="XMLLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="EnterMethod" sink="XMLLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="ExitMethod" sink="XMLLog" delete="false" / &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="CheckSucceeded" sink="BeaconLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Checkpoint" sink="BeaconLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Comment" sink="BeaconLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Debug" sink="BeaconLog" delete="false" / &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="CheckSucceeded" sink="Debug" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Checkpoint" sink="Debug" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Comment" sink="Debug" delete="false"/ &#62; 
	
	&#60; Rule kind="Debug" sink="Debug" delete="false" / &#62; 

The following gives an example of an MS-ADFSPIP_ClientTestSuite.ptfconfig in which the Sinks and Profile nodes are commented out.

## <a name="_Toc374100997"/>Debugging Test Cases

You can use the Visual Studio solution (.sln) file included with this test suite to debug additional test cases that you create for your protocol implementation. 

![image2.png](./image/MS-ADFSPIP_ClientUserGuide/image2.png)
Note 

* Check the values in MS-ADFSPIP_ClientTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig under C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADFSPIP\Client-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Source\Client\TestCode\TestSuite are correct

To debug a test case

* On the driver computer, use Microsoft® Visual Studio® to open the following solution file:
C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADFSPIP\Client-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Source\Client\TestCode\MS-ADFSPIP_Client.sln

* In Visual Studio, in the Solution Explorer window, right-click the **Solution** **‘MS-ADFSPIP_Client’**, and select **Build Solution**.

* In the Solution Items folder, click **MS-ADFSPIP_Client.vsmdi**, and then select the names of the test scenarios that you want to debug. 

## <a name="_Toc374100998"/>Troubleshooting

This section describes how to troubleshoot common issues in running test cases.

### <a name="_Toc374100999"/>Unable to set the network to Private

| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| ------------- |
| PROBLEM| The Network Location is set to Public and unable to change to Private. | 
| CAUSE| The Network Location feature provides an easy way to customize your firewall settings based on whether you trust or don’t trust the computers around you. There are three Network Location types - Private, Public and Domain. If your computer is a member of the domain then you won’t be able to change the Network Location type. If your computer is standalone or part of the workgroup, then you can choose what type of network location do you want - Public or Private. Private means that you are a member of the trusted network and you can lower your network security a little bit. Public means that you have no trust for the network outside, and you should not let your guard down.| 
| | The network location is per connection/network card. Every time a new connection is added - the dialog will appear, asking you to choose the network location type. However, there is no direct way to change the network location once it is set at the first time. We can only use PowerShell script to change it.| 
| | Setting the correct network location type is very important for Windows PowerShell Remoting. You cannot enable Windows PowerShell Remoting on your machine if your connections are set to Public. It means you won’t be able to connect to this machine using Windows PowerShell Remoting. | 
| RESOLUTION| Try to run the following PowerShell script:| 
| |  &#35; Skip network location setting for pre-Vista operating systems if([environment]::OSVersion.version.Major -lt 6) { return }  
| |  &#35; Skip network location setting if local machine is joined to a domain. if(1,3,4,5 -contains (Get-WmiObject win32_computersystem).DomainRole) { return }  
| |  &#35; Get network connections $networkListManager = [Activator]::CreateInstance([Type]::GetTypeFromCLSID([Guid] "{DCB00C01-570F-4A9B-8D69-199FDBA5723B}")) $connections = $networkListManager.GetNetworkConnections()  
| |  &#35; Set network location to Private for all networks $connections  &#124;  % {$_.GetNetwork().SetCategory(1)}| 

### <a name="_Toc374101000"/>Unable to Specify UPN When Joining Workplace

| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| ------------- |
| PROBLEM| When performing Workplace Join, there is no prompt shown on UI asking for user account or password information.| 
| CAUSE| It is probably because the computer has joined domain. If the computer has joined domain, Windows use WIA to retrieve user credential information, so no prompt will be shown.| 
| RESOLUTION| If you want to use customized account information, quit the computer from domain, and logon with local account.| 

### <a name="_Toc374101001"/>Cannot Workplace Join with Build-in Administrator

| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| ------------- |
| PROBLEM| When log on user is the build-in Administrator account, Workplace Join failed after receiving discovery result.| 
| CAUSE| It is by design that build-in Administrator cannot use Workplace Join.| 
| RESOLUTION| Log on with other accounts.| 

### <a name="_Toc374101002"/>Cannot Trigger SUT to Join Workplace

| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| ------------- |
| PROBLEM| The scripts to trigger Windows-based SUT to join workplace do not work properly.| 
| CAUSE| The scripts to trigger a Windows-based SUT to join workplace are done by sending keystokes to simulate the actual Workplace Join operations. | 
| | Many uncertain facts will effect this kind of UI automation, such as whether the Windows is activated, or if there is process interrupt the automation.| 
| RESOLUTION| Make sure the automation scripts are running on a clean system, and no other user processes are running except the listener script.| 
| | Check the Windows UI, if there are changes in UI related to Workplace Join, the scripts will fail. Modify the scripts to make sure the keystoke sequence matches the actual UI operations.|
