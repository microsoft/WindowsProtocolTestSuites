## <a name="_Toc395793817"/>Run Test Cases 

![image3.png](./image/BranchCache_UserGuide/image3.png)
Note

Before running the test cases, you can modify the configuration file accordingly: from the              desktop double-click **Open Branch Cache Test Suite Directory** and go to **Bin** folder, open **BranchCache_TestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** and modify it if needed.

Log on to **Client** with account **contoso\administrator** and password **Password01!**

### <a name="_Toc395793818"/>Run the BVT Test

This test suite includes a set of basic tests called "BVT". Together these test cases perform a basic functionality test to evaluate the implementation on ContentServer and HostedCacheServer. Use the options below to run all BVT test cases.

* From the desktop double-click the **Run Branch Cache Test Cases** shortcut

* Select the SUT (System under test)

* Select content information transport (Optional, only when Content Server is selected as SUT)
**Note** 

* _There are two kinds of transport test cases currently support: PCCRTP and SMB2. From batch file, you can select one of them to run. Select PCCRTP means that all the test cases with category PCCRTP are in the ready to run list, under this situation, you need to update the the property value in named “ContentTransport” in BranchCache_TestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig to “PCCRTP”, so does for transport “SMB2”._

* Select the branch cache version

* Select the BVT only test cases

### <a name="_Toc395793819"/>Run All Test Cases

Use the steps below to run all test cases.

* From the desktop double-click the **Run Branch Cache Test Cases** shortcut

* Select the SUT (System Under Test)

* Select the  content information transport (Optional, only when Content Server is selected as SUT)

* Select the branch cache version

* Select all test cases

### <a name="_Toc395793820"/>Run Test Cases with source code from Visual Studio

Use the steps below to run specific test cases.

* From the desktop, double-click the **Open Branch Cache Test Suite Directory** shortcut

* Double click through Source\BranchCache\TestCode

* Start Visual Studio with administrator privileges

* Open BranchCache.sln in the previously started Visual Studio, and build the solution

* When you build the test project, the test cases appear in **Test Explorer**. If Test Explorer is not visible, choose **Test** on the Visual Studio menu, choose **Windows**, and then choose **Test Explorer**

* Select test cases and run

### <a name="_Toc395793821"/>Check Test Results
The handling of test results involves both the review of the log files and the management of their generation. This section describes those topics.

#### <a name="_Toc395793822"/>Review the log files

You can find the log files in the **TestResults** directory, a subdirectory of Batch folder in the test suite installation directory. The log files that contain test suite results use a  **&#42; .trx** file name, in which the asterisk (" &#42; ") character represents the user name, the protocol name, or both.

Additional log files are used for generating requirement coverage reports and diagnosing test issues. Their settings can be found in the  **&#42; .ptfconfig** or  **&#42; .deployment.ptfconfig** files. The file names, corresponding paths, and formats can be set in the Sinks node of the configuration file. 

The following instruction provides an example of how to cause log entries for the "XMLLog" logging sink to be written into the BranchCache_Log.xml file in the current directory, you can remove this rule if you don’t want to write this entry into log.

&#60; File id="XMLLog" directory=".\TestLog" file="BranchCache_Log.xml" format="xml"/ &#62; 

#### <a name="_Toc395793823"/>Manage the generation of log files
For further information about logging in the Protocol Test Framework (PTF), see the _PTF User Guide_ in the PTF installation directory.

## <a name="_Toc395793824"/>Debug Test Cases 

You can use the Visual Studio solution (.sln) file included with this test suite to debug additional test cases created to test protocol implementations.

![image3.png](./image/BranchCache_UserGuide/image3.png)
Note 
Copy BranchCache_TestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig from C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\BranchCache\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Bin to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\BranchCache\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Source\BranchCache\TestCode\TestSuite and replace the original file.

To debug a test case

* On the computer running the test suite, use Microsoft® Visual Studio® with Administrator privileges to open the following solution file:
C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\BranchCache\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Source\BranchCache\TestCode\BranchCache.sln

* In the Solution Explorer window of Visual Studio, right-click the **Solution 'BranchCache'**, and select **Build Solution**.

* When you build the test project, the test cases appear in **Test Explorer**. If Test Explorer is not visible, choose **Test** on the Visual Studio menu, choose Windows, and then choose Test Explorer.

* Select the test cases from **Test Explorer** and debug them.

To use the debug tool

![image3.png](./image/BranchCache_UserGuide/image3.png)
Note 

>This **Hash Generation and Verification Tool** is used to verify whether the hash value recieved from the remote server is consistent with local calculations. The tool can also be used just to calculate the hash value of a local file.

* This debug tool can be found on the desktop after the BranchCache test suite is installed, double-click the shortcut to open the tool. The window is shown as below:

![image30.png](./image/BranchCache_UserGuide/image30.png)

* Configure the options below to enable the debug tool:

	* **Branch Cache Version:** Choose V1 or V2 to support the BranchCache according to the implementation guidelines.
	
	* **Operation Mode:** **RemoteHashVerification** is used to verify whether the hash generation of remote server is consistent with the local-calculated one; **LocalHashGeneration** is used to calculate the hash value of the appointed local file. 
	
	* **Transport:** The transport supports PCCRTP and SMB2. If PCCRTP is chosen, you should input the file path like “[http://Server/FileName.txt](http://server/FileName.txt)” in the next File Path; Else if SMB2 is chosen, the file path input should be like [\\Server\SharedFolder\FileName.txt](file://server/SharedFolder/FileName.txt). Otherwise you can use **Browse** to point to the remote file location.

	* **Hash Algorithm:** This option is set according to the version you choose. This is based on the protocol and not configurable.

	* For other options, such as Domain, User Name, Password, Authentication, you can configure them in the input box, or read them from configuration file.

* After the above configurations are set, click **Execute** to run the tool. If there are no errors during verification, the result will be shown as below:

![image31.png](./image/BranchCache_UserGuide/image31.png)

Otherwise, the result will be shown as below:
