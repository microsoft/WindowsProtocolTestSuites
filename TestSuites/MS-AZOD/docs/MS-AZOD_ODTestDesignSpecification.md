## <a name="_Toc426559895"/>Introduction
This document provides information about how MS-AZOD is designed to test MS-AZOD technical document usability and accuracy. It gives the analysis of MS-AZOD technical document content, and describes test assumptions, scope and constraints of the test suite. It also specifies test approach, test scenarios, detail test cases, test suite architecture and adapter design.

## <a name="_Toc426559896"/>Technical Document Analysis
The MS-AZOD test suite is used to test authorization process of file sharing, so it depends on protocols MS-AZOD and MS-SMB2.

### <a name="_Toc426559897"/>Technical Document Overview
Authorization Protocols Overview (MS-AZOD) is an overview document, which descripts the authorization process of controlling access to resources. The document introduces 3 authorization models: 

* DAC and CBAC models

* AzMan RBAC model 

* COM+ roles  access control model 

The DAC model is suited for the well-defined persistent resources such as Active Directory, files, and the registry. CBAC is an extension to the DAC model, applicable for file resources on a file server.
The Authorization Manager-based RBAC model provides a natural framework for business process applications that require representing the organizational model within the application security framework. In Microsoft Windows®, remote desktop gateway applications use this model.
The COM+ roles authorization model is applicable for the applications that are developed using COM and COM+ development frameworks.
Therefore, the AZOD with file sharing test suite is focus on the test of DAC and CBAC models. **The architecture of CBAC model is shown as following:**

### <a name="_Toc426559898"/>Relationship to Other Protocols 
MS-AZOD is an overview document, so it depends on specific protocols. The following table provides a comprehensive list of the Authorization member protocols and data structures.

|  **Protocol name**|  **Description**|  **Short name**|  **Applicability**| 
| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
| Privilege Attribute Certificate Data structure| The Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) is used by the authentication protocols to carry authorization information. The authorization information consists of group memberships and claims. The PAC also contains additional credential information, profile, policy information, and additional security data.| [[MS-PAC]](file:///C:/Users/t-fhan/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/[MS-PAC].pdf)| DAC, CBAC, and COM+ roles access control| 
| Remote Authorization API Protocol | The Remote Authorization API protocol enables applications to remotely create, query, and manipulate authorization context for a given security principal on a target server for the purpose of administrative queries. The protocol initiates creation of a security context, transfers the group and claims information, and accesses requests and result data sent between client and server.| [[MS-RAA]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252283)| DAC and CBAC| 
| Authorization Manager (AzMan) Policy File Format| The Authorization Manager (AzMan) Policy File Format contains the XML schema definitions of Authorization Manager access control policies.| [[MS-AZMP]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=234296)| AzMan RBAC| 
| Group Policy Central Access Policies Protocol Extension| The Group Policy: Central Access Policies Extension is a group policy file format that communicates the Central Access Policies (CAPs) defined centrally and configured for specific computer accounts and transferred to the file servers through group policy.| [[MS-GPCAP]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245480)| CBAC| 
| Central Access Policy Identifier (ID) Retrieval Protocol Specification| This protocol enables the applications to query a remote file server for a list of Central Access Policies (CAPs) that have been configured for a remote file server. Specifically, the protocol is used to transfer the CAP IDs.| [[MS-CAPR]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252281 )| CBAC| 
| Claims Transformation Algorithm | This document specifies a grammar for describing transformation rule language and an algorithm for transforming input claims into output claims using a defined set of rules. Transformation of a set of claims is typically used at the authentication trust traversal boundaries to transform claims from sending authority into a form acceptable to receiving authority.| [[MS-CTA]](file:///C:/Users/t-fhan/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/[MS-CTA].pdf)| CBAC| 
| Windows Data Types| This document contains the data types and algorithms associated with authorization.| [[MS-DTYP]](file:///C:/Users/t-fhan/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/[MS-DTYP].pdf)| DAC, CBAC, and COM+ roles| 
| Lightweight Directory Access Protocol | In CBAC: This protocol enables the applications to configure the claim definitions, and the user and devices claims on the Active Directory Server.| [[MS-ADTS]](file:///C:/Users/t-fhan/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Word/[MS-ADTS].pdf)| DAC, CBAC, and AzMan RBAC| 
| | In RBAC: This protocol enables the retrieval of authorization policies from the Active Directory Policy Server.| | | 
| | In DAC: [MS-ADTS] section 5.1.3 specifies the authorization rules.| | | 
| Component Object Model Plus (COM+) Remote Administration Protocol| With regards to authorization, this protocol enables the administration interface for the role-based security configuration for the COM+ applications.| [[MS-COMA]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=234304)| COM+ roles access control| 
| Tabular Data Stream Protocols| With regards to authorization, this protocol enables the retrieval of the authorization policies from the SQL Policy Store | [[MS-TDS]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120874)| AzMan RBAC| 

Besides, there are other protocols related to MS-AZOD:

* [MS-KILE]: Kerberos Protocol Extensions

* [MS-SFU]: Kerberos Protocol Extensions: Service for User and Constrained Delegation Protocol

* [MS-NLMP]: NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol

* [MS-SMB2]: Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Versions 2 and 3

## <a name="_Toc426559899"/>Test Method

### <a name="_Toc426559900"/>Assumptions, Scope and Constraints
**Assumptions:**

* The DC and SMB File server should be configurable.

**Scope:**
In scope

* The Client computer, DC and SMB File server will be tested.

* For Windows, the System Under Test (SUT) will be Server SKUs for DC and SMB file server, and will be Client SKUs for Client computer

* Simple DAC and CBAC authorization on file server will be tested

* Authorization data embedded in other protocol will be verified.

* Kerberos, NTLM, and SMB2 messages sequence, which are used to process authorization, will be tested.

Out scope

* Except for authorization data, PAC structure for example, other Kerberos, NTLM, and SMB2 message field need not to be verified.

### <a name="_Toc426559901"/>Test Approach
Test Approach:
The test suite will be developed based on traditional testing. 
Some tests use an observer to capture and verify message sequence among client computer, DC and file server. These tests depend on Message Analyzer API to capture and parse messages.
Some tests use a synthetic client, Kerberos, NTLM and SMB2 message will be used during these tests, so the test suite depends on these protocols’ SDK. 
Test Approach Comparison
Table 1-1 illustrates the comparison of test approaches for the MS-AZOD test suite.

| &#32;| &#32;| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
|  **Factor**|  **MBT**|  **Traditional**|  **Best Choice**| 
|  **Simple logic**| The main logic is simple, if added to the model, the model would become more complicated. Besides, MBT will require more initial effort and will be more difficult to maintain.| Traditional testing is good at dealing with simple logic, which would only increase the complexity if using a model.| Traditional| 
|  **Small test case number**| The test suite focuses on scenarios which is the combination of AZOD and file sharing. The number of test cases is not expected to be very large. | It is easy to create useful test cases with traditional testing. | Traditional| 
|  **Simple parameter combinations**| Parameter combination is not complex. | It is easy to cover all combinations of parameters with traditional testing.| Traditional| 

***Table 1-1 Test Approach Comparison***
Reasons for choosing Traditional Testing:
The AZOD with file sharing scenarios are stateless and error states are very simple.
Message exchange is simple (authentication process and file access process).
Previous artifacts can be reused for traditional testing.
The combinations of parameters are not complex. Capability settings can be easily configured using the configuration files.

#### <a name="_Toc426559903"/>S1_AccessFile_SMB2_CBAC_Kerberos
Preconditions:

* The client computer and server computer are joined to the same Active Directory domain.

* The client computer, application server and Domain Controller are CBAC aware.

* The file server and file resource manager roles have been configured on the server computer.

* The required user accounts and associated group memberships have been configured on an Account Database (see [MS-ADOD]).

* Created claim types, resource (file) properties, and central access rules (CARs) are configured on DC and then added to the central access policies using the Active Directory Administration center tool.

* The intended central access policies (CAPs) have been targeted to the file server computer using the Group Policy Management tool and the CAPs to the required file shares have been enabled.

* The required association of claims for the user and computer accounts has been set.

* Classification rules have been pushed onto the file server through the LDAP (carried File Classification Infrastructure structures, as described in [MS-FCIADS]) Protocol.

* File share(s) have been created on the server computer and the appropriate shared permissions configured. 

* Central Access Policy is applied to share folder on application server.

Typical Sequence:
The typical scenario sequence is the following:

* The SMB2 client sends **NEGOTIATE Request**.

* SMB2 server reply a **NEGOTIATE Response** with **GSS SpnegoToken** [MS-SPNG].

* The SMB2 Client sends a **KRB_AS_REQ** message to the KDC. This message includes the user principal name and a list of supported encryption types in preferred priority order to encrypt the pre-authentication data, but does not include the pre-authentication data since its function is to discover the supported encryption types.

* Because the request message does not contain the pre-authentication data, the KDC responds with a **KRB_ERROR** and with a list of supported encryption types in its priority order.

* The SMB2 Client sends **KRB_AS_REQ** message for a **ticket-granting ticket (TGT)** with PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP as pre-authentication data to the KDC. The client builds the pre-authentication data by encrypting its timestamp with a secret key derived from the user's password using an agreed-on encryption method. Since domain controller requests **claims** with EnableCBACandArmor set be TRUE, the client adds a PA-PAC-OPTIONS [167] (MS-KILE section 2.2.9) PA-DATA type with the Claims bit set in the KRB_AS_REQ to request claims authorization data.

* The KDC builds the TGT with a PAC that contains group membership (and claims) information in the authorization_data field of the TGT, generates a **KRB_AS_REP** message from the TGT and the session key, and sends the **KRB_AS_REP** message back to the client.

* The SMB2 Client sends a **KRB_TGS_REQ** based on the TGT to obtain a service ticket for the SMB2 server. The KRB_TGS_REQ message includes the TGT, the authenticator, and the Service Principal Name (SPN) as cifs/servername.domain, where servername is the actual name of the SMB2 server computer, and domain is the domain or realm of the client computer.

* The KDC validates the ticket-granting ticket (TGT) and the authenticator. If these are valid, the KDC returns a service ticket for the SMB2 server and a session key for communication between the SMB2 client and the SMB2 server in a **KRB_TGS_REP** message.

* The SMB2 client send **SESSION_SETUP** request with **KRB_AP_REQ** to SMB2 Server. The KRB_AP_REQ is built with a TGT and the authenticator created by encrypting the Username, IP address, and a timestamp with the session key received in step 8.

* The SMB2 server generates a signature and sends the SMB2 client a SMB2 **SESSION_SETUP** Response containing the signature and a GSS security token. The GSS security token contains a **KRB_AP_REP**.

* **TREE_CONNECT**: Client sends SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Request to the Server.

* The Server responses an SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Response. 

* If flags of Packet header contains SMB2_FLAGS_SIGNED, the packet should be signed, client should use **subkey** from **KRP_AP_REP** to sign the packet; otherwise, the signature field of Packet header should be 0.

* **TREE_DISCONNECT**: The client sends SMB2 TREE_DISCONNECT Request to the server

* **LOGOFF**: The client sends SMB2 LOGOFF Request to the server

* **TREE_DISCONNECT**: The server response SMB2 TREE_DISCONNECT Response.

* **LOGOFF**: The server response SMB2 LOGOFF Response.

* The SMB2 Client builds the GSS-API Spnego Token with an **AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE** ([MS-NLMP] section 2.2.1.3), creates the **SMB2 SESSION_SETUP Request** with the GSS token and sends it to the SMB2 server.

* File server binds to the remote Netlogon RPC endpoint on DC. File server sends **Bind** request to DC.

* The DC response a **Bind** **ACK** to the file server. 

* To validate the security token, the File Server sends NETLOGON_ NETWORK_INFO message to the DC as an input argument **LogonInformation** to the **NetrLogonSamLogonEx** method.

* The Domain Controller validates the request message and returns either the NETLOGON_VALIDATION_SAM_INFO2 or the NETLOGON_VALIDATION_SAM_INFO4 message as an output argument to **NetrLogonSamLogonEx**.

Figure 3-2 AZOD Test Suite Architecture – Synthetic client

As shown in the Figure 3-2, the test suite is consisted of a synthetic client and a traffic observer.
Synthetic Client: act as a client computer, trigger authentication, file access and authorization.
Traffic Observer: observe the traffic between File server and DC. The computer running test suite will be configured as network gateway, so that it can observe all the network traffic.

### <a name="_Toc426559912"/>Technical Dependencies/Considerations

#### <a name="_Toc426559913"/>Dependencies
There are no dependencies.

#### <a name="_Toc426559914"/>Technical Difficulties 
There are no technical difficulties.

### <a name="_Toc426559915"/>Adapter Design

#### <a name="_Toc426559916"/>Adapter Overview
There are three adapters used in the test suite: protocol adapter, Message Analyzer adapter and SUT control adapter.
The protocol adapter is used to receive messages from the SUT and to send messages to the SUT. The protocol adapter is built upon the protocol test framework, which is implemented with managed code. 
Message Analyzer adapter is used to capture message, and parse the captured message to verify whether the message sequence is expected.
The SUT control adapter is used to trigger the SUT to make some configurations, or run some powershell/shell scripts during test run, or send messages to the file server or DC.

* Config Message Analyzer adapter with parameters.

public bool **StartCapture**(bool isVerify=true);

* Start MA to capture messages.

public bool **StopCapture**();

* Stop MA capture. Save captured message to a capture file.

public void **ParseAndVerify**(string captureFilePath, bool saveResult = false)

* Compare captured message sequence and expected message sequence, save the parsed messaged if needed.

#####Message Analyzer Adapter
Message Analyzer (MA) adapter use MA API to capture message and parse the captured message to verify message sequence.
Expected message sequence will be configured in an xml file. Therefore, if OPN updated message name, the test suite only need to update these xml file accordingly.
Expected message sequence is defined by set of expected messages with a specific order. Each expected message is consisted of:

* Message Name

* Source

* Destination

For some expected messages, only message name, source and destination cannot make sure whether it is the expected message. So it is necessary to verify message’s field value. Therefore, the MA adapter defines xml node for each message which need to verify field values. 

#####SUT Adapter
In Windows Implementation testing, The SUT control adapter is implemented using PowerShell scripts. The PowerShell scripts remotely run the tasks created on Client and File Server.

|  **Description** | This template describes the test cases of access check against a share folder on a CBAC aware file server.| 
|  **Prerequisites**| KDC and all computers in domain should enable CBAC.| 
| | Create user claim on DC: Company. Company claim has suggested values: contoso and kerb.| 
| | Create a central access rule  &#60;  ***CAR***  &#62; .| 
| | Create different users  &#60;  **User**  &#62;  with this user claim &#60;  ***Claims***  &#62;  for same  &#60; CAP &#62; | 
| | Create central access policy  &#60; **CAP** &#62; and add the central access rule  &#60;  ***CAR***  &#62; .| 
| | Add  &#60; **CAP** &#62; to domain group policy.| 
| | Publish group policy to all endpoint in domain with command “gpupdate /force” in DC.| 
| | On file server, create a share folder  &#60;  ***Sharefolder***  &#62;  and apply  &#60; **CAP** &#62; to it.| 
|  **Test Execution Steps**| Enable cbac on client computer| 
| | Cleanup the cached ticket on client| 
| | Different users with different claims on client computer attempts to access file server with user claim and expect to create a file to the folder successfully.| 
| | Client sends a SESSION_SETUP request to the file server| 
| | The file server sends an SMB2 SESSION_SETUP response message to the client.| 
| | Client is authenticated using  &#60; user &#62;  and complete SESSION_SETUP phase through Kerberos.| 
| | Client completes SMB2 TREE_CONNECT phase with file server.| 
| | Client sends SMB2 CREATE request, whose ShareAccess field contains FILE_SHARE_READ and FILE_SHARE_WRITE.| 
| | Expect file server replies a SMB2 CREATE Response| 
| | Client completes the following SMB2 phases with file server| 
| | WRITE| 
| | CLOSE| 
| | TREE_DISCONNECT| 
| | LOGOFF| 
| | The write request will be granted since the user claim meets the CAP requirement. |
