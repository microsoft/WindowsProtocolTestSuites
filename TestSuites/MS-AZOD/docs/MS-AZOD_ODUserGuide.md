## <a name="_Toc426622624"/>Appendix: Build the Cross-realm Trust Relationship between Windows AD and MIT KDC

### <a name="_Toc426622625"/>Overview
This document is prepared for the installation of Windows AD and MIT KDC, and the guide for building the cross-realm trust relationship between AD and KDC. Moreover, extra descriptions will be given.
The configurations are tuned to adapt the Winterop Protocol testing environment, and are NOT meant to be applied to any production environments. In the rest of the document, I will assume machines in the following table to have machine names, domain/realm etc. Make necessary adjustment if any machine/domain/realm differs in your own test environment.

| &#32;| &#32;| &#32;| &#32;| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
| Machine| Machine Name| Domain/Realm| Role| Build| IP Address| 
| Windows AD| DC01| MS.KERB| DC| Windows Server 2012| 172.16.0.1/2012::1| 
| MIT KDC| kdc| MIT.KERB| KDC| Fedora17/Krb5-1.10| 172.16.0.254/2012::254| 
| Win Client| win8| MS.KERB| Client| Windows 8| 172.16.0.101/2012::101| 
| Linux Client| client| MIT.KERB| Client| Fedora17| 172.16.0.201/2012::201| 

### <a name="_Toc426622626"/>Configuring the MIT KDC

#### <a name="_Toc426622627"/>Install Fedora 17

* In order to compatible with Hyper-V, a Fedora-17-KDE version is recommended. Also, you SHOULD select the proper Time Zone such as Shanghai etc.  and UNCHECK System clock uses UTC. Configure a “Legacy Network Adapter” to your VM and make sure it’s connected to the External Network.

**

![image7.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image7.png)
**

* Disable the Linux Desktop GUI(KDE) from System Boot (logon as root, the same below).

* Disable the NetworkManager to enable IPV4 Address.

* Disable the iptables. In order to support IPv6, you must disable the ip6tables.

#### <a name="_Toc426622628"/>Install MIT KDC

* Install the necessary packages in the Master KDC. Before this, you MUST configure the proper yum repository and http proxy (An example of 163 mirrors is below). . Append the following to /etc/profile:

Here jpnproxy.fareast.corp.microsoft.com is used in Shanghai site. Please replace the server with your site’s preferred proxy server. 

* Then, you can begin install the MIT KDC.

* Change the network to your own environment, since the MIT KDC will run in this internal network. Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 to this:

* Configure the DNS name server and restart network. Edit /etc/resolv.conf to this:

* Also, you must specify the host name if you didn’t before. Edit /etc/sysconfig/network to this:

* Specify the hosts file. Edit /etc/hosts to this:

* Follow up instructions on [http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-current/doc/krb_admins/install_kdc.html &#35; edit-kdc-configuration-files](http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-current/doc/krb_admins/install_kdc.html). An example of /etc/krb5.conf is below. 

An example of /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf is below.

* Create the KDC database on the MIT KDC realm.

This will create five files in /var/kerberos/krb5kdc (or at the locations specified in kdc.conf):
●two Kerberos database files, principal, and principal.ok
●the Kerberos administrative database file, principal.kadm5
●the administrative database lock file, principal.kadm5.lock
●the stash file, in this example .k5.MIT.KERB. If you do not want a stash file, run the above command without the -s option.

![image8.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image8.png)

* Add administrators to the Access Control List (ACL) file. You need create an ACL file and put the Kerberos principal of at least one of the administrators into it. This file is used by the kadmind daemon to control which principals may view and make privileged modifications to the Kerberos database files. The ACL filename is determined by the acl_file variable in kdc.conf; the default is /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl. Here is an example of a kadm5.acl.

* Add administrators to the Kerberos database. For example, admin/admin.

* Create a new user account in the MIT KDC as a test User, such as [mituser@MIT.KERB](mailto:mituser@mit.kerb). Also, you had better add the pre-authentication attribute to this user.

* Start the Kerberos daemons on the MIT KDC. You can verify that they started properly by checking for their startup messages in the logging locations you defined in krb5.conf (see [logging]).Any errors the daemons encounter while starting will also be listed in the logging output.

* As an additional verification, check if kinit succeeds against the principals that you have created on the previous step.

### <a name="_Toc426622629"/>Configuring the Windows DNS and AD

#### <a name="_Toc426622630"/>Install DNS Server
Install Windows DNS.
Run dnsmgmt.msc
Right Click Forward Lookup Zones- &#62; New Zone… (use default settings)
Name the New Zone with the realm name of the MIT KDC. 
Navigate to DNSDC01Forward Lookup ZonesKERB
Right click KERB and create New Domain for MIT.KERB. Then, create SRV for Kerberos service, Kpasswd service and Host (A) for the KDC host. For example in MIT.KERB, (1) create _kerberos._udp.MIT.KERB and _kerberos._tcp.MIT.KERB on port 88 offered by host kdc.mit.kerb; (2) create _kpasswd._udp.MIT.KERB and _kpasswd._tcp.MIT.KERB on port 464 offered by host kdc.mit.kerb; (3) create IPv4 and IPv6 address-to-host resolution for kdc.mit.kerb.
For any machine joining MIT.KERB realms: For example Client joining MIT.KERB, (1) create IPv4 and IPv6 address-to-host resolution for client.mit.kerb.

![image9.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image9.png)

#### <a name="_Toc426622631"/>Install Windows AD
Install Windows AD with domain MS.KERB.
Create a new user account in the Active Directory as a test user, such as msuser.

To avoid dispensable troubles, you had better open the 88 port or close the firewall.

### <a name="_Toc426622632"/>Setting Trust between Windows AD and MIT KDC

#### <a name="_Toc426622633"/>Configure the Windows AD

* Set up access to services. Workstation computers that use services in an MIT realm need to have a realm entry added and enable delegation across the realm trust. To do this, use the Ksetup command on Windows AD that uses the MIT realm for services.

* Start the Active Directory Domains and Trusts snap-in, Right-click on **Properties** of your domain (MS.KERB), then select the **Trusts** tab and select **New Trust**.

* Create a trusted domain relationship with the MIT Kerberos realm using the following parameters:

* Trust Name:  &#60; MIT.KERB &#62; 

* Trust Type: Realm trust

* Transitivity of Trust: Transitive 

* Direction of Trust: Two-way

* Trust Password:  &#60; provide the password you created for the MIT Kerberos realm, this password will be mentioned in the next section &#62; 

* The sequence of these steps is shown in the following screenshots:

*

![image18.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image18.png)

#### <a name="_Toc426622634"/>Configure the MIT KDC

* Use the following MIT Kerberos administration commands to create cross-realm principals in the foreign MIT realm (note that the commands is typically run on MIT KDC).

* After executing each of these commands you will be prompted to supply a password for the account. This password should match the password supplied when creating the Cross-Realm trust in the Active Directory Domains and Trusts snap-in as performed previously in section 4.1.

* To be careful, there may be some clock problems because of the different time between DC and KDC. You should sync the time, for example, let Windows AD as the Time Server(NTP). Run this command in the MIT KDC to sync.

#### <a name="_Toc426622635"/>Create account mappings

* Account mappings are used to map a foreign Kerberos identity (in a trusted non-Windows Kerberos realm) to a local account identity in the domain. These account mappings are managed through the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in.

* These account mappings will allow the non-Windows Kerberos realm to act as an account domain. Users with non-Windows Kerberos principals that have mappings to domain accounts, can logon to a workstation that is joined to a trusted domain using the non-Windows Kerberos principal and password from the non-Windows Kerberos realm.

* Start the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in, start advanced features by clicking View, and then Advanced Features as shown below.

* 

![image19.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image19.png)

* Locate the account to which you want to create mappings, and right-click to view **Name** **Mappings**. This example uses the account msuser.

* 

![image20.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image20.png)

* Click the **Kerberos Names** mappings tab, add a principal from the foreign MIT realm. The example shown below uses [mituser@MIT.KERB](mailto:mituser@mit.kerb).

* 

![image21.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image21.png)

#### <a name="_Toc426622636"/>Verify the cross-realm trust relationship
There are some features to show the cross-realm trust relationship has been built before. Also, you can install the clients, such as Windows 8 client and Fedora client, to join each realm as a member of realm user. You can run your own services such as File Sharing or Web Service in the client that has joined one of this realms, and logon from the client of other realm using the other realm’s users. But I just show the relationship’s features and left the other testes to yourself.
First, if the cross-realm trust relationship has been built, there must be some users in the Active Directory. Open the **ADSI Edit**, move to **CN=Users**, you can find **CN=krbtgt** and **CN=MIT.KERB$** as below.

![image22.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image22.png)

Move to **CN=System**, you can find trustedDomain **CN=MIT.KERB**.

![image23.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image23.png)

On the other hand, there must be some users in the MIT KDC as the red circle show below.

![image24.png](./image/MS-AZOD_ODUserGuide/image24.png)

Of course, the verifications show above cannot be absolutely valid. You must try your own test case to verify the trusting relationship such as Samba. I will not give it in this document.
