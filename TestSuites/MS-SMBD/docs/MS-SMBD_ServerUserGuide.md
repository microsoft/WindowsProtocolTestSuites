## <a name="_Toc395696820"/>Network Setup

Run this test suite in a domain or a non-domain environment using either physical or virtual machines. This section is about the non-domain test environment using physical machines. 

For information about configuring a virtual machine, see [http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/en/us/solution-appliance-test.aspx](http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/en/us/solution-appliance-test.aspx). The configuration of virtual machines for this test suite is not covered in this user guide. 

#### <a name="_Toc395696821"/>Network Environment

The domain environment requires interactions between the following computers and servers. 

* The driver computer runs the test cases by sending requests over the wire in the form of protocol messages. 

* The SUT runs an implementation of the protocol that is being tested. The SUT responds to the requests that the driver computer sends.

The following figure shows the domain environment with recommended network configurations for your reference.

| &#32;| &#32;| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
| Machine Name/Access Point| NIC Type| IPv4| Subnet Mask| 
| SMBD-Client01| NIC| 192.168.1.111| 255.255.255.0| 
|  | RDMA-NIC| 192.168.1.11| 255.255.255.0|

|  | RDMA-NIC| 192.168.1.12| 255.255.255.0| 

#### <a name="_Toc395696822"/>Verify Connectivity

After you set up the environment, verify the connection between the driver computer and the SUT over both the NIC and the RDMA-NIC. You can use the following steps to check the connectivity between the two Windows-based computers. For further information about other operating systems, see the administration guide for your operating system.

To check the connection from the driver computer

![image2.png](./image/MS-SMBD_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)
Note 


* Disable active firewalls in the test environment.

* Press WinKey+R to launch **Run**. 

* In the **Run** dialog box, type **cmd** and then click **OK**.

* **Ping** the IP address of the NIC.

* **Ping** the IP address of the RDMA-NIC.

Do not proceed with the configuration of the test suite until connectivity is confirmed. Any issue with the network connectivity must be resolved before configuring the test suite.

## <a name="_Toc395696830"/>Running Test Cases

This test suite includes command files that you can use to run some basic test cases. Each test case verifies the protocol implementation based on a given scenario. 

You can find these command files in the following directory: 
C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMBD\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch

You can run these command files either in the command prompt or by selecting and clicking in the File Explorer.

### <a name="_Toc395696831"/>Run the BVT Test Cases

This test suite contains a set of basic test cases called Basic Verification Test (BVT). These test cases perform basic functionality tests to evaluate the implementation on the SUT. Use the steps below to run all BVT test cases.

To run the BVT test cases 

* Double-click the **Run MS-SMBD Server-BVTTestCases** shortcut on the desktop of the driver computer.
Alternatively, go to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMBD\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch, and run the **RunBVTTestCases.cmd** file. 

### <a name="_Toc395696832"/>Run All Test Cases

Use the steps below to run all the test cases.

To run all the test cases 

* Double-click the **Run MS-SMBD Server-AllTestCases** shortcut on the desktop of the driver computer.
Alternatively, go to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMBD\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch, and run the **RunAllTestCases.cmd** file. 

### <a name="_Toc395696833"/>Check the Test Results
This section describes the review of log files and the management of their generation.

#### <a name="_Toc395696834"/>Review the Log Files 

You can find the log files in the "TestResults" directory, a subdirectory of Batch folder in the test suite installation directory. The log files that contain test suite results use a  &#42; .trx file name, in which the asterisk (" &#42; ") character represents the user name, the protocol name, or both.

Additional log files are used for generating requirement coverage reports and diagnosing test issues. Their settings can be found in the  &#42; .ptfconfig or  &#42; .deployment.ptfconfig files. The file names, corresponding paths, and formats can be set in the Sinks node of the configuration file. 

The following instruction provides an example of how to cause log entries for the "Debug" logging sink not to be written into the MS-SMBD_Log.xml file in the current directory:
 &#60; File id="XMLLog" directory=".\TestLog" file="MS-SMBD_Log.xml" format="xml"/ &#62;  

#### <a name="_Toc395696835"/>Manage the Generation of Log Files
For further information about logging in the Protocol Test Framework (PTF), see the _PTF User Guide_ in the PTF installation directory

## <a name="_Toc395696836"/>Debugging Test Cases

You can open the Visual Studio Solution file (.sln) installed with this test suite to debug additional test cases that you create for your protocol implementation. 

![image2.png](./image/MS-SMBD_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)
Note 
Copy SM-SMBD_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig from C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMBD\Server-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Bin to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMBD\Server-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Source\Server\TestSuite and replace the original file

To debug a test case

* On the driver computer, use Microsoft® Visual Studio® to open the following solution file:
C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMBD\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Source\Server\TestCode\MS-SMBD_Server.sln

* You will be prompted to upgrade the project to .Net 4.5, select do not upgrade option.

* In Visual Studio, in the Solution Explorer window, right-click the **Solution ‘MS-SMBD_Server’**, and select **Build Solution**.
