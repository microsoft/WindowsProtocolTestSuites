## <a name="_Toc427489479"/>Introduction
This document provides information about how MS-SMBD test suite is designed to test MS-SMBD technical document usability and accuracy. It gives the analysis of MS-SMBD technical document content, and describes test assumptions, scope and constraints of the test suite. It also specifies test approach, test scenarios, detail test cases, test suite architecture and adapter design.

## <a name="_Toc427489480"/>Technical Document Analysis

### <a name="_Toc427489481"/>Technical Document Overview
The SMB2 RDMA Transport Protocol defines a framing for the exchange of arbitrary upper-layer data over RDMA-capable networks in a peer-to-peer fashion. The protocol allows for bidirectional traffic of variable size and does not require any particular upper-layer communication pattern, such as client-server. Accordingly, the protocol is well-suited to support SMB2 exchanges, which exhibit a mix of client and server requests and responses, asynchronous unsolicited messages from server to client, unacknowledged requests such as cancellation, and an extremely wide range of sizes.

RDMA networks provide high-bandwidth and low-latency data services, and adapters supporting RDMA typically provide a local control interface offering extremely low processing overhead for sending and receiving messages. Additionally, the RDMA functions of the network provide for further reduction of overhead by moving bulk data directly between memory buffers on each peer, under the control and protection of upper layers such as SMB2. The results can radically reduce network overhead on a cycles per byte transferred basis.

The SMB2 RDMA Transport Protocol also defines interfaces and peer-visible descriptors for registering buffers which enable RDMA access, advertised to the peer for read or write on a specific connection. These buffer descriptors allow the upper layer to steer direct placement traffic, without requiring the upper layer to interface with the RDMA lower layer directly.

### <a name="_Toc427489482"/>Relationship to Other Protocols
RDMA Transports
The RDMA transports most commonly used by SMB2 RDMA Transport Protocol include:

* iWARP, as specified in [[RFC5040]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=230446) and [[RFC5041]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=230447).
* Infiniband Reliable Connected mode, as specified in [[IBARCH]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=230464).
* RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), as specified in [[ROCE]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=230465).

Protocols Transported by SMB2 RDMA Transport Protocol
The following protocol uses SMB2 RDMA Transport Protocol as a transport and provides access to enhanced data transfer functionality:

* The SMB2 Protocol, when SMB2 dialect 3.x family is negotiated by both client and server and when an RDMA-capable transport is available for connection among the peers.

Additional Related Protocols

* The functionality provided by the SMB2 RDMA Transport Protocol, when accompanied by an RDMA transport, provides similar transport service to that of standard TCP/IP. Protocols such as SMB2 which define an existing layer over [TCP](file:///C:/Users/jash/AppData/Local/CodeFlow/DpkCache/0B7E6832B01C417C8796A1E7A46E20A1/0/Mod/[MS-GLOS].pdf) can employ either or both to implement communications between peers.

The following block diagram represents the preceding relationships, with optional protocol relationships represented by dashed outlines, subject to appropriate standards to define a mapping.

### <a name="_Toc427489483"/>Protocol Operations/Messages
The following figure shows an initial exchange of SMBD traffic beneath a typical SMB2 Protocol stack.

![image3.jpeg](./image/MS-SMBD_ServerTestDesignSpecification/image3.jpeg)


* The client sends “Negotiate request” to server.

* The server sends back “Negotiate response” to client.
After negotiate, the client can exchange message with server for upper layer message.

* The client sends “Data transfers” to server, with upper layer package “SMB2 traffic” as payload.

* The server sends “RDMA transfers” message to the client with upper layer’s message.
It might send bulk of data according to the size of the message.

### <a name="_Toc427489484"/>Protocol Properties
* MS-SMBD is a block protocol.
* MS-SMBD is WSPP protocol.
* MS-SMBD is not MCPP protocol.
* MS-SMBD is transport-independent.
* MS-SMBD requires only an RDMA lower layer. In the lower layer RDMA transports most commonly used by MS-SMBD include: iWARP, Infiniband Reliable Connected Mode ([[IBARCH]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=230464)) and RDMA over Coverged Ethernet ([[ROCE]](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=230465)). 
* MS-SMBD is used by an upper layer protocol [MS-SMB2]. 

## <a name="_Toc427489485"/>Test Method

### <a name="_Toc427489486"/>Assumptions, Scope and Constraints
**Assumptions**

* Test Suite Driver are running in Windows Server 2012 R2 x64 operating system.
* The SUT should support SMB2 dialect 3.x family and SMBD.

**Scope**

* SMBD operations described in [MS-SMBD].
    * SMBD Negotiate request/response;
    * SMBD Data Transfer;
    * SMBD Managing Credits;
* SMB2 operations over RDMA channel.
    * SMB2 READ file over RDMA Channel;
    * SMB2 WRITE file over RDMA Channel;
    * SMB2 Multiple Channels;

**Out of Scope**

* SMBD Register/Deregister Buffer.
* Protocol Client endpoint (SMBD Client), playing the client role, is out of scope for testing. 

**Constraints**
There are no constraints for this protocol.

### <a name="_Toc427489487"/>Test Approach
**Traditional based test approach** is suggested for MS-SMBD Protocol Test Suite Development based on the following factors: 

* Finite-state machine of this protocol is simple.
* Test cases are similar enough to share a substantial amount of code.
* Simple Abstract Data Model. 

Test cases will be generated by hand and checked through a series of assertions to determine test case failure or success.

## <a name="_Toc427489495"/>Test Suite Design

### <a name="_Toc427489496"/>Test Suite Architectures

#### <a name="_Toc427489497"/>System under Test (SUT)
From the third party point of view, the SUT is a component that implements MS-SMBD.
From the Windows implementation point of view, the SUT is Windows Server 2012 R2.

#### <a name="_Toc427489498"/>Test Suite Environment

![image4.png](./image/MS-SMBD_ServerTestDesignSpecification/image4.png)

There are one Test Suite Driver and System Under Test (SUT) in MS-SMBD test environment. Both of them are installed RDMA-capable NIC (R-NIC) and non-RDMA-capable NIC (NIC). All R-NICs and NICs are assigned IPv4 or IPv6 address.

#### <a name="_Toc427489499"/>Test Suite Architecture

![image5.png](./image/MS-SMBD_ServerTestDesignSpecification/image5.png)

**Server Under Test:** MS-SMB2, MS-SMBD and TCP/IP protocols MUST be implemented on SUT.
**Test Suite Driver:** There are three main components, including SMBD Test Suite, SMBD and RDMA Test Suite Library. SMBD Test Suite requires SMB2 Test Suite Library to trigger the message sequence on SMBD. And RDMA Test Suite Library use the capability of RDMA NIC with Network Direct User Model Programming Interface (NDSPI). In theory, SMBD test suite can run over all types of RDMA protocols though there are variable RDMA protocols.

### <a name="_Toc427489500"/>Technical Dependencies/Considerations

#### <a name="_Toc427489501"/>Dependencies
There are dependencies listed below.

* [Protocol Test Framework (Latest Version)](https://github.com/microsoft/protocoltestframework)
* It provides the libraries for test case and test class initialization, adapter initialization, test suite configuration, test result validation, and test logging.
* Test Suite Library.
* SMBD Test Suite requires related Test Suite Library for transportation purpose.
* RDMA Driver.
* RDMA drivers are required to installed and configured in both client and server side, so that they could establish RDMA connection.

#### <a name="_Toc427489502"/>Technical Difficulties 
There are some technical difficulties list below:

* It is hard to cover all types of RDMA protocols.

* The RDMA protocols most commonly used by SMBD include: iWARP, Infiniband, RoCE. They require different physical network adapters. 

#### <a name="_Toc427489503"/>Encryption Consideration
There is no encryption consideration.

#### <a name="_Toc427489504"/>Other Considerations

* There are no other considerations.

### <a name="_Toc427489505"/>Adapter Design

#### <a name="_Toc427489506"/>Adapter Overview
The MS-SMBD test suite protocol adapter.

The protocol adapter is used to send message to the SUT and receive message from the SUT. It is built upon the Test Suite Library, which is implemented with managed code.

#### <a name="_Toc427489507"/>Technical Feasibility of Adapter Approach
Protocol Adapter
The protocol adapter uses Test Suite Library to generate protocol messages, which are sent to SUT. The MS-SMBD Test Suite Library will parse and decode the received messages and send them to protocol adapter.

#### <a name="_Toc427489508"/>Adapter Abstract Level

#### <a name="_Toc427489509"/>Adapter Inner Work

## <a name="_Toc427489510"/>Test Cases Design

### <a name="_Toc427489511"/>Traditional Test Case Design
The Traditional test approach is used to design all test cases. The test cases are designed to cover all in-scope testable requirements, including both positive and negative requirements. 

### <a name="_Toc427489512"/>Test Cases Description 

The test suite is a synthetic SMBD client. In the following descriptions, all instance of the term “Test Suite” can be understood as the SMBD client.

Below are some terms which are used in test case description:

* **R-NIC**: RDMA capable network interface

* **Non R-NIC**: None RDMA capable network interface

In this test suite, “Establish SMB2 session and open file” means message sequence of SMB2, including SMB2 NEGOTIATE, SMB2 SESSION_SETUP, SMB2 TREE_CONNECT and SMB2 CREATE.
In this test suite, there is no requirement captured. So “Requirements covered” are “N/A”, all the requirement will check directly in test code using BaseTestSite.Assert.
