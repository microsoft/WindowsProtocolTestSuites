### <a name="_Toc426644919"/>Software 
All of the following software must be installed on the driver computer ***before*** the installation of this test suite. 

**Required Software**

All common softwares listed in [prerequisites](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites#prerequisites) for running Windows Protocol Test Suites.

* **Windows PowerShell 3.0**

  **Windows PowerShell 3.0** is required.

* **Microsoft Message Analyzer**

  **Microsoft® Message Analyzer** (MMA) is required for this test suite to analyze the network traces and validate the message sequences, structures and fields per scenario.

  ![image2.png](./image/ADFamily_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)Note
  
  You can download the latest Message Analyzer (MA) from the website below. We need to install MA so that our test cases will call MA library to do live capture and verification of the network trace. It’s all automatic process, so users will only need to install the latest version of MA first. [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226)

* **Open XML SDK**

  ![image2.png](./image/ADFamily_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)Note
  
  You can download the latest Open XML SDK from the website below. It is used to load the schema definitions in XML format from technical documents. [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30425](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30425)

**Optional Software**

* **Protocol Test Manager**

    **Protocol Test Manager** provides a graphical user interface (UI) to facilitate configuration and execution of Microsoft® Windows Protocol Test Suite tests. Its use is highly recommended.

## <a name="_Toc426644920"/>Network Setup

Run this test suite in a domain environment using either physical or virtual machines. This section describes the test environment using physical computers. 

For information about configuring a virtual machine, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/create-virtual-machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/create-virtual-machine). The configuration of virtual machines for use with this test suite is out of the scope of this guide. 

### <a name="_Toc426644921"/>Domain Environment

The domain environment requires interactions between the following computers and server roles. 

* The driver computer runs the test cases and request messages over the Ethernet.

* The SUT (every DC) runs an implementation of the protocol that is being tested. The SUT responds to the requests that the driver computer sends.

* Any additional computer and server role is specified to provide functionality that is required to test the protocol implementation.

The following figure shows the domain environment and the recommended network configurations.

## <a name="_Toc426644954"/>Configuration

This section explains how to configure the test environment.

### <a name="_Toc426644955"/>Configuring the Test Suite

This test suite is installed with default configuration settings. You may need to change these settings if you use a customized test environment or if you customize your test runs. 

You can configure the test suite for various purposes including, for example, to:

* Define the settings of the test environment, including computer names and IP addresses.

* Define the folders and formats used for output from test runs.

To change configuration settings, edit the  &#42; .deployment.ptfconfig files including 

AD_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig

You can find the files in

C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\FileSharing\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \ Server\TestCode\TestSuite\

#### <a name="_Toc426644956"/>Protocol Test Manager
The configuration files can be not only changed manually, but also can be changed by using a UI tool named Protocol Test Manager (PTM). Please go to [Section 12](#_Toc426644963) to see the detailed information.

## <a name="_Toc426644957"/>Running Test Cases

This test suite includes command files that you can use to complete some basic test cases. Each test case verifies the protocol implementation based on a given scenario. 

You can find and run these test cases in the following directory: 

C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\ADFamily\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch

You can run these command files at the command prompt, or by selecting and clicking one or more of the files from the directory.

### <a name="_Toc426644958"/>Run Test Cases by Specific Protocol

This test suite family includes a set of protocols. Use the steps below to run test cases by specifying the protocol name.

To run the test cases by specific protocol in a Domain environment

* Go to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\ADFamily\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch, and double-click the **Run &#60; Protocol Name &#62; Cases.cmd** file. 

### <a name="_Toc426644959"/>Run All Test Cases

Use the steps below to run all test cases.

To run all test cases in a Domain environment

* From the desktop of the driver computer, double-click the **Run ADFamily Server-RunAllTestCases** shortcut. This shortcut is created during the installation process.
Alternatively, go to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\ADFamily\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch, and double-click the **RunAllTestCases.cmd** file. 

### <a name="_Toc426644960"/>Run Test Cases by Category

Use the steps below to run test cases category.

To run test cases by category in a Domain environment

* From the desktop of the driver computer, double-click the **Run ADFamily Server-RunTestCasesByCategory** shortcut. This shortcut is created during the installation process.
Alternatively, go to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\ADFamily\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch, and double-click the **RunTestCasesByCategory.cmd** file. 

### <a name="_Toc426644961"/>Check Test Results
Test suite generates test result files in different paths based on the way how test case is executed.
* For running test case with batch: C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\ADFamily\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version_ &#35;  &#62; \Batch\TestResults

* For running test case with PTM: C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\ADFamily\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version_ &#35;  &#62; \TestResults

* For further information about logging in the Protocol Test Framework (PTF), see the _PTF User Guide_ in the PTF installation directory

## <a name="_Toc426644962"/>Debugging Test Cases

You can use the Visual Studio solution (.sln) file included with this test suite to debug additional test cases that you create for your protocol implementation. 

![image2.png](./image/ADFamily_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)
Note

* Clone the source code from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites) and open the solution file(AD_Server.sln) under **WindowsProtocolTestSuites\TestSuites\ADFamily\src** folder.

* While using Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2017 or above to run test cases, test suite may throw exception with message of “Cannot get test site”. To solve this issue, please select the test settings file under test settings menu.

* Test result can be checked under WindowsProtocolTestSuites\TestSuites\ADFamily\src\TestResults folder.

To debug a test case

* On the driver computer, use Microsoft® Visual Studio® to open the following solution file:
C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\ADFamily\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Source\Server\TestCode\AD_Server.sln

* In Visual Studio, in the Solution Explorer window, right-click the **Solution ‘AD_Server’**, and select **Build Solution**.

* When you build the test project, the tests appear in **Test Explorer**. If Test Explorer is not visible, choose **Test** on the Visual Studio menu, choose **Windows**, and then choose **Test Explorer**.

* Select your test cases from Test Explorer and run or debug them.  

## <a name="_Toc426644963"/>Using Protocol Test Manager
