## <a name="_Toc427583961"/>Protocol Summary
The Storage Quality of Service (QoS) Protocol is a block-based protocol that is used to manage the Quality of Service configuration of I/O flows targeting remote files accessed over SMB3.
The Storage QoS protocol is used to exchange configuration, metric and status data between the client and the server. The protocol allows a storage flow to be identified and a policy to be assigned to the operations belonging to the flow. For the purpose of illustrating the protocol behaviors, this specification assumes that on the server side there exists a Storage QoS implementation that is responsible for implementing policies by performing tasks such as collecting metrics, computing I/O rates for logical flows, determining status of logical flows, and manipulating I/O request queues to satisfy throughput requirements.

## <a name="_Toc427583962"/>Test Scope

### <a name="_Toc427583963"/>System under Test (SUT)
This test suite will test the server endpoint of MS-SQOS, and test suite acts as client role.
In Windows, the server role is acted by a scale-out file server which is made up of the nodes running Windows 10 or later. And the test suite acts a Hyper-V host. The below picture illustrates the roles including both test suite and SUT in Windows implementation.

### <a name="_Toc427583964"/>Restrictions
None

### <a name="_Toc427583965"/>Dependencies

#### <a name="_Toc427583966"/>Transport
This protocol depends on Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Version 3 for its transport.

#### <a name="_Toc427583967"/>Prerequisites/Preconditions
An SMB client has established a connection to an SMB server and has opened a remote .vhdx file. This has to be done before a client can issue any Storage QoS Protocol commands.

## <a name="_Toc427583968"/>Test Environment

### <a name="_Toc427583969"/>Non-Windows Implementation
For non-windows implementation, a vhdx file (sqos.vhdx) should be put under a share of the SUT.

### <a name="_Toc427583970"/>Windows Implementation
For windows implementation, it shares the same environment with FileSharing test suite family except adding one vhdx file in the scale-out file server and the OS version of nodes which make up of the scale-out file server should be Windows 10 or later.

Details of the environment is specified in section 1 of FileSharing_ServerTestDesignSpecification.docx

### <a name="_Toc427583972"/>Test Suite Architecture

![image5.png](./image/MS-SQOS_ServerTestDesignSpecification/image5.png)

### <a name="_Toc427583973"/>Test Case Design
The Storage Quality of Service (QoS) Protocol allows a client application to perform the following high-level operations:

* Define a [logical flow](#z3) and specify a [QoS Policy](#z6) for the logical flow.

* Provide data used to compute I/O performance metrics for a logical flow.

* Retrieve status information for a logical flow.

3 BVT test cases and 9 negative cases are designed to cover the above scenarios.

#### <a name="_Toc427583974"/>BVT Test Cases
The first two BVT cases are to set or probe the SQOS policy for a logical flow. And then they check the response of querying status request to validate if the policy is set correctly.
The last BVT case is to test if the SUT can handle update counters request correctly. The case cannot verify if the metrics in SUT is updated, it just verifies the response to the update counters request.
