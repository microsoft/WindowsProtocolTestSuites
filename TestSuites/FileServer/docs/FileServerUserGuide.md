##<a name="1"/>Introduction

This guide provides information about how to install, configure, and run File Sharing Test Suite in its environment. This suite is designed to test implementations of file server protocol family including Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Version 2 and 3, File Server Remote VSS Protocol and Service Witness Protocol, The Distributed File System (DFS): Namespace Referral Protocol, Remote Shared Virtual Disk Protocol, as specified in the Microsoft document *\[MS-SMB2\], \[MS-FSRVP\] , \[MS-SWN\], \[MS-DFSC\], \[MS-FSA\], \[MS-SQOS\] and \[MS-RSVD\].* This guide provides information about using this test suite on the Microsoft® Windows® operating system and on operating systems that are not Windows based.

This suite tests only the protocol implementation behaviors that are observed on the wire. For detailed information about the design of this test suite, please see *TestDesignSpecification.*.
