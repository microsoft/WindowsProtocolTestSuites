## <a name="1"/> 1 Introduction

This user guide provides the fundamentals for using the **File Server Protocol Family Test Suite**. In this guide, you will learn how to do the following:

* Install the test suite.
* Configure the network for the test environment.
* Set up the Driver computer, system under test (SUT), and other computers.
* Set up the test configuration.
* Run the test cases

The **File Server Protocol Family Test Suite**, hereinafter referred to as the **Test Suite**, is designed to test implementations of the File Server protocol family, which includes [the following protocols that are documented on the Microsoft Technical Documents site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj712081.aspx):

* [**[MS-SMB2]**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246482.aspx) (Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Version 2 and 3)
* [**[MS-FSRVP]**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh554852.aspx) (File Server Remote VSS Protocol)
* [**[MS-SWN]**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh536748.aspx) (Service Witness Protocol)
* [**[MS-DFSC]**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc226982.aspx) Distributed File System (DFS): Namespace Referral Protocol
* [**[MS-SQOS]**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt226249.aspx) (Storage Quality of Service Protocol)
* [**[MS-RSVD]**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn393384.aspx) (Remote Shared Virtual Disk Protocol
* [**[MS-FSA]**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff469524.aspx) (File System Algorithms)

This guide specifies the details for using the **Test Suite**  with both Microsoft® Windows® operating system and non-Windows based operating system environments. However, the details about non-Windows systems are limited to generalities, as the focus of setup and configuration is on Windows systems in this User Guide.

### <a name="1.1"/> 1.1 Testing Environments

You can use the **Test Suite** to perform test cases against your implementation in either a **WORKGROUP** or **DOMAIN** environment. You might choose the **WORKGROUP** environment if you are new to the protocol test suites or if you want to simplify the setup and environment in which to perform test cases. On the other hand, you might choose the **DOMAIN** environment if you want to run test cases against your implementation in a more comprehensive environment that more closely resembles a real world environment containing a Domain Controller, File Server, Storage Server, and Clustering.

Whichever environment you choose, the details in this document specify the steps you should take to set up the chosen environment in which you plan to run your tests. For example, if you choose the **WORKGROUP** environment, you would simply ignore the steps that apply to the **DOMAIN** environment and vice-versa.

The **Test Suite** examines protocol implementation behaviors that are observed over the wire only.

    See section [3.3.1 Driver Computer Minimum Requirements](#3.3.1) for hardware requirements and section [5.1.1 Set up the Driver Computer in the Workgroup Environment](#5.1.1) for setup instructions.

  * **SUT computer** (Node01) − this machine can be for hosting either a Windows or non-Windows implementation. For a Windows implementation, the SUT computer must be running the Microsoft® Windows Server 2012 R2, Standard Edition or later operating system.

    See section [3.3.2 System Under Test (SUT) Minimum Requirements](#3.3.2) for hardware requirements and section [5.1.2 Setup the SUT Computer in the Workgroup Environment](#5.1.2) for setup instructions.

* To run the Test Suite in a DOMAIN environment, the test machines in the list that follows are required (either physical or virtual). See [Figure 2: Domain environment network configuration](#fig.2) for reference.

  * **Domain Controller** (DC01) – this machine can be running either a Windows or non-Windows operating system.

    ![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

    If you choose to set up a non-Windows computer, you do so at your own discretion.

    See section [3.3.3 Domain Controller (DC) Minimum Requirements](#3.3.3) for hardware requirements and section [5.2.1 Set up the Domain Controller for the Domain Environment](#5.2.1) for setup instructions.

  * **Driver computer** (Client01) − this machine must be running the Microsoft® Windows 8.1 Enterprise operating system or later.

    See section [3.3.1 Driver Computer Minimum Requirements](#3.3.1) for hardware requirements and section [5.2.2 Set up the Driver Computer for the Domain Environment](#5.2.2) for setup instructions.

  * **Clustering** − if you want to test cluster scenarios, you will need the following machines:

    * **Storage Area Network (SAN) server** (Storage01) − as part of the SUT configuration, this machine can be for testing either a Windows or non-Windows implementation.

      See section [3.3.4 SAN Storage Server](#3.3.4) for hardware requirements and section [5.2.3 Set up the SAN Storage Server](#5.2.3) for setup instructions.

    * **Failover cluster computers** (Node01, Node02) − as part of the SUT configuration, these machines can be for testing either a Windows or non-Windows implementation. Note that 2 SUT computers are required if you are deploying a Windows implementation.

      See section [3.3.2 System Under Test (SUT) Minimum Requirements](#3.2.2) for hardware requirements and section [5.2.4 Set up the SUT for the Domain Environment](#5.2.4) for setup instructions.

  * **Non Clustering** − if you are not testing clustering scenarios, you will need the following:

    * **SUT computer** − this machine can be for testing either a Windows or non-Windows implementation.

      ![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

      If you want to adjust an existing environment for testing non-clustering scenarios, you can simplify your deployment steps by using a node in an existing Failover Cluster configuration as the SUT computer.

**More Information**

To learn more about Failover Cluster scenarios, see the **Test Suite Design** section in the [File Server Protocol Family Test Design Specification](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/blob/staging/TestSuites/FileServer/docs/FileServerTestDesignSpecification.md).

### <a name="3.4"/> 3.4 Software

All of the following software must be installed on the driver computer. They have some dependencies on each other, it is recommended to install them in the order listed below so that they can work correctly.

**Required Software**

All common softwares listed in [prerequisites](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites#prerequisites) for running Windows Protocol Test Suites.

**Optional Software**

* **Protocol Test Manager**

    **Protocol Test Manager** provides a graphical user interface (UI) to facilitate configuration and execution of Microsoft® Windows Protocol Test Suite tests. Its use is highly recommended.

* **Microsoft Message Analyzer**

    **Microsoft® Message Analyzer** (MMA) is listed here as an optional tool because the test cases of themselves neither perform live captures or capture verifications during execution. However, MMA can be helpful with debugging test case results, by analyzing ETL files that are generated by the Test Cases, that is, if you enable the the Automatic Network Capturing feature in the Protocol Test Manager (PTM) during test case configuration. The Automatic Network Capturing feature is further described in the [PTF User Guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/ProtocolTestFramework/blob/staging/docs/PTFUserGuide.md#-automatic-network-capturing).

    ![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)Note

    You can download the latest Message Analyzer from below website. [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226)

## <a name="4"/> 4 Network Setup

This section describes how to set up the network for both the **WORKGROUP** and **DOMAIN** environments, which are described earlier in section [3.2 Environment Configuration](#3.2).

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

You can deploy the **Test Suite** on either physical or virtual machines. However, the sections that follow describe the deployment on physical machines only.

**More Information**

To learn more about how to configure a virtual machine, see
[Create Virtual Machine with Hyper-V on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/create-virtual-machine)

### <a name="4.1"/> 4.1 Workgroup Network Environment

#### <a name="4.1.1"/> 4.1.1 Workgroup Message Architecture

Computers in the **WORKGROUP** network environment interact with each other as follows:

* The Driver computer (Client01) runs test cases which generate  requests that are sent over the wire as protocol messages to the SUT (Node01) computer.

* The SUT computer responds to the requests from the Driver computer by running an implementation of the test protocol, which returns a response that is evaluated by a particular test case.

#### <a name="4.1.2"/> 4.1.2 Workgroup Network Architecture

The following diagram shows the **WORKGROUP** environment with recommended network configurations for reference. Note that all the settings are configurable.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

The suggested settings in the following diagram apply to both Windows-based computers and non-Windows based computers in a **WORKGROUP** environment, however, note that this User Guide documents the Windows case only.

<a name="fig.1"></a>

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image3.png)

Figure 1. Workgroup environment network configuration

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

As a non-Windows SUT computer, **Node01** should host an implementation-specific system under test.

<a name="table.7"></a>

**Table 7. Suggested machine names and network configuration for the WORKGROUP environment**

| Machine Name/Access Point | NIC       | IPv4          | Subnet Mask   |

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

The addresses that are specified in the IPv4 column of this table and other tables are placeholders for actual addresses that you should specify. Also, note that the Driver computer (Client01) and the SUT computer (Node01) each require dual network interface cards (NICs), as indicated by the "External1" and "External2" designations, for complete testing of all scenarios.

### <a name="4.2"/> 4.2 Domain Network Environment

#### <a name="4.2.1"/> 4.2.1 Domain Message Architecture

Computers in the **DOMAIN** environment interact with each other as follows:

* The Driver computer runs test cases which generate requests that are sent over the wire as protocol messages to one or more SUT computers, for example, computers comprising a Failover Cluster configuration.

* The SUT/s respond/s to requests from the Driver computer by running an implementation of the protocol which returns a reply that is evaluated by a particular test case.

* The domain controller (DC) responds to security authentication requests such as logging in, checking permissions, and so on, within the domain.

* Other interactions include when the Driver computer runs test cases to generate messages over the wire that run protocol implementations for testing the functions and capabilities of the storage area network (SAN) backend storage for the Failover Cluster.

#### <a name="4.2.2"/> 4.2.2 Domain Network Architecture

The following diagram shows the **DOMAIN** environment with recommended network configurations for reference. Note that all settings are configurable.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

The suggested settings in the following diagram apply to Windows based computers in the DOMAIN environment only.  However, non-Windows based computers are also supported in this environment. Note that dual network interface cards (NICs) are required on the Driver, SUT, and DC computers, as indicated by the "External1" and "External2" designations.

In Clustering scenarios, the Driver computer (Client01 in figure 2) contacts the **Node01** and **Node02** SUT computers, which are configured as Failover Cluster nodes. The Storage Area Network (SAN) server computer **Storage01** is on an isolated network and provides backend storage for the Failover Cluster.

In non-clustering scenarios as well, the Driver computer contacts whichever node is acting as the SUT computer.

<a name="fig.2"></a>

### <a name="4.3"/> 4.3 Verify Network Computer Connectivity

After setting up the host computers and the network configurations in either the **WORKGROUP** or **DOMAIN** environment, perform the following steps to test connectivity between Windows-based computers.

**More Information**

To learn more about testing computer connectivity, see the Administrative Guide for your operating system.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

Before performing the steps that follow, disable all active firewalls in the test environment . For Windows computers, see section [5.3.13 Turn off Firewalls](#5.3.13).

To check connectivity from the Driver computer to the SUT computer/s as well as other computers in your test environment, perform the following steps:

  1. Click the **Start** button on the Driver computer **Client01** and then click **Run**.

  2. In the **Run** dialog box, type `cmd` and then click **OK**.

  3. At the command prompt on the Driver computer, type the command `ping` followed by a space and then type the hostname or IP address of the SUT **Node01** computer, for example:

  ```
      ping Node01
  ```

  4. Press the **Enter** key on the Driver computer keyboard and verify that you receive 4 ping responses at the command line from the **pinged** computer.

  5. Repeat these steps for other computers in your test environment to confirm that there are no network connectivity issues.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Caution**

Do not proceed further with the setup until you have verified the proper connectivity of all machines in your environment, according to the previous procedure. Otherwise, network connectivity issues may block  further configuration in the steps that follow.

## <a name="5"/> 5 Computer Setup

As indicated earlier, the Test Suite can be executed in either the **WORKGROUP** or **DOMAIN** environment, as described in section [3.2 Environment Configuration](#3.2).

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image2.png)**Important**

When setting up the Driver and SUT computers in either the **WORKGROUP** or **DOMAIN** environment, the procedures specify the use of particular names for items such as passwords, sharenames, and so on. Note that in most cases these are only suggested names that you can change to accommodate your specific environment, at your discretion.

### <a name="5.1"/> 5.1 Workgroup Environment

The **WORKGROUP** environment consists of two test machines as follows:

* **Driver computer** – must be running the Microsoft® Windows 8.1 Enterprise or later operating system version.

* **SUT computer** – must be running the Microsoft® Windows Server 2012 R2, Standard Edition or later version operating system for implementations in the Windows environment; in non-Windows environments, the operating system running on the SUT computer is at your own discretion, as is the implementation being tested on that computer.

#### <a name="5.1.1"/> 5.1.1 Set up the Driver Computer for the Workgroup Environment

This section describes how to set up the Driver computer for the **WORKGROUP** environment.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image2.png)**Important**

Microsoft® Visual Studio, the Protocol Test Framework, and Spec Explorer must be installed on the Driver computer **before** you run the **Test Suite** installer. See section [3.4 Software Requirements](#3.4).

Perform the steps that follow to set up the Driver computer:

1. Configure IP addresses along with subnet masks and set the computer name to **Client01**. See section [4.1 Workgroup Environment](#4.1).

2. Make sure all firewall are turned off.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

For more information about turning off the firewall on Windows platforms, see section [5.3.13 Turn off Firewalls](#5.3.13).

3. Install the required software, as described in section [3.4 Software Requirements](#3.4), which includes installing the **FileServer-TestSuite-ServerEP.msi** package onto the Driver computer.

4. For x64-based machines, start Windows PowerShell (x64) with Administrator privileges by right-clicking the Windows **Start** menu and selecting **Windows Power Shell (Admin)**; then type following command:  

  ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  ```

5. For x86-based machines, start Windows PowerShell (x86) with Administrator privileges by right-clicking the Windows **Start** menu and selecting **Windows Power Shell (Admin)**; then execute the same command as immediately above.

6. Create a new folder with path **%SystemDrive%\\FileServerCaptureFileDirectory**. This folder can be used to save the event trace log (ETL) files automatically generated by the Test Cases, which files you can analyze with Microsoft® Message Analyzer. Note that generation of ETL files will occur only if you enable **NetworkCapture** on the **Configure Test Cases** tab of the PTM and that you run the PTM as Administrator.

#### <a name="5.1.2"/> 5.1.2 Setup the SUT Computer in the Workgroup Environment

This section describes several ways to set up the SUT computer, according to the subsections that  follow:

1. Configure IP addresses on the SUT computer and set the computer name to **Node01**, as described in section [4.1 Workgroup Environment](#4.1).

2. Turn off the SUT computer firewall.

    For Windows platforms, see section [5.3.13 Turn off Firewalls](#5.3.13).

3. Ensure that the local **Administrator** account is enabled (which should be enabled by default) and create a local non-Administrative account named **nonadmin** for use with some test cases.

    For Windows platforms, see the following sections:

    [5.3.14 Enable the Local Administrator Account](#5.3.14)

    [5.3.15 Create a Local Non-Admin User Account](#5.3.15)

4. Ensure that the password for the local **Administrator** and **nonadmin** accounts are set to **Password01!**.

    See section [5.3.17 Reset Password for Local Users](#5.3.17).

5. Enable the Windows **Guest** account as described in section [5.3.16 Enable the Local Guest Account](#5.3.16). The Guest account is used in some test cases.

6. Reset the password for the **Guest** account to **Password01!**.

    See section [5.3.17 Reset Password for Local Users](#5.3.17).

In sections [5.1.2.2 Setup to test SMB2](#5.1.2.2) through [5.1.2.5 Setup to test SQOS](#5.1.2.5) that follow, you will create the configurations necessary for testing the Server Message Block (SMB) and other protocols.

##### <a name="5.1.2.2"/> 5.1.2.2 Setup to test SMB2

The procedures in the subsections that follow create the  test configurations that you will use to test an MSSMB2 protocol implementation.

###### <a name="5.1.2.2.1"/> 5.1.2.2.1 Create a basic share

This configuration is used to test the basic features of an MS-SMB2 protocol implementation, for example, the **Encryption** and **Oplock** features.

To create a basic SMB share, perform the steps that follow:

  1. Create a shared folder named **SMBBasic** on the SUT computer (**Node01**).

  2. Ensure that the **SMBBasic** folder is shared with **Read/Write** permissions to the local **Administrator** account that is enabled by default or you enabled earlier in section [5.1.2.1 Common Setup](#5.1.2.1).

    * On the **Run Selected Test Cases** tab of **Protocol Test Manager**, run test cases in either of the following ways:

      * **Run All** – click this link to run all test cases.

      * **Run Selected Test** – click this link to run the selected test cases.

      After the test cases complete execution, you can view test case logs to the right of the test case listview, by selecting any test case in the listview.

      ![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

      You can drag the separator between the test case treeview and the log pane to adjust the width of the window for better viewing.

      ![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image2.png)**Important**

      If you run all the core/preconfigured test cases and your environment does not support certain features, you will see errors in the command console, in the test cases listview, and in the right-hand side log pane of PTM, with respect to methods that failed when attempting to test those features. To avoid this, you can simply run only the test cases that apply to your environment.

    ![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

    **Protocol Test Manager** also has a command line interface (**ptmcli.exe**) that you can use to automate the running of test cases with a selected Profile.
    * You can locate the **ptmcli.exe** tool in the **..\\bin** folder under the **Protocol Test Manager** installation path in the **Program Files** directory. To use this tool, you will need to specify the path to a saved Profile name with the `-p` switch:

      `ptmcli.exe -p <profileName>`

    * To display help for the **ptmcli.exe** tool, specify the `-h` switch at the command line:

      `ptmcli.exe -h`

### <a name="7.2"/> 7.2 Configure the Test Suite Manually

The **File Server Protocol Family Test Suite** is installed with default configuration settings. However, you have the option to modify these settings according to your specific test environment needs. For example, you can configure the **Test Suite** in the following ways:

* Define the settings of the test environment, including computer names, IP addresses, passwords, and so on. For example, you could modify these particular entities from the **CommonTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file in Visual Studio. The directory location for the **.ptfconfig** files is specified later in this section.

You can also change configuration settings by editing the **\\*.deployment.ptfconfig** files, which includes  the files in the following list. A brief description of each file is also included here:

* CommonTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig – the common settings in the **CommonTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are shared by all the sub test suites that follow.

* ServerFailoverTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig − settings in **ServerFailoverTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are for the File Server failover test suite.

* MS-DFSC_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig − settings in the **MSDFSC_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are for the Distributed File System (DFSC) server test suite.

* MS-FSRVP_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig − settings in the **MSFSRVP_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are for the File Server Remote VSS Protocol (FSRVP) server test suite.

* MS-SMB2_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig − settings in the **MSSMB2_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are for the Server Message Block (SMB2) test suite.

* MS-SMB2Model_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig − settings in the **MSSMB2Model_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are for the Server Message Block (SMB2) model test suite.

* MS-RSVD_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig − settings in the **MSRSVD_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are for the Remote Shared Virtual Disk (RSVD) server test suite.

* MS-SQOS_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig − settings in the **MSSQOS_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are for the Storage Quality of Service (SQOS) server test suite.

* Auth_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig − settings in the **Auth_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig** file are for the Auth test suite.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

You can locate the .ptfconfig files in the following directory location after the **File Server Protocol Family Test Suite** is installed:  **%SystemDrive%\\MicrosoftProtocolTests\\FileServer\\Server-Endpoint\\&lt;version#&gt;\Bin\\** The data in these XML files is invoked whenever you run test cases with the use of either **batch scripts** or the **Protocol Test Manager**.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image2.png)**Important**

For specific configuration details, refer to a corresponding \*.deployment.ptfconfig file. The configuration files contain &lt;Description&gt; tags that describe the purpose of configurable items.

### <a name="7.3"/> 7.3 Run Test Cases with Batch Scripts

The **File Server Protocol Family Test Suite** includes command (**.cmd**) batch files that you can use to run some basic test cases. Each test case verifies a protocol implementation based on a predefined scenario. You can run the .cmd test case files directly from the following directory:

**%SystemDrive%\\MicrosoftProtocolTests\\FileServer\\Server-Endpoint\\&lt;version#&gt;\\Batch\\**

To run these batch files, either double-click one or more of them directly from the specified directory location or run them from a command prompt.

#### <a name="7.3.1"/> 7.3.1 Run the BVT Tests

This **Test Suite** includes a set of basic tests known as BVT tests. Together these test cases perform basic functionality tests that evaluate an implementation residing on an SUT computer. The BVT test cases are basic tests of specific features that should pass, which therefore makes them high priority tests.  You are advised to run the BVT test cases first and then run other test cases.

To run the BVT test cases in a **WORKGROUP** or **DOMAIN** environment, perform the appropriate steps that follow:

1. To run the **BVT** test cases in a **WORKGROUP** environment:

    * From the desktop of the Driver computer, double-click the **Run FileServer ServerWorkgroup_BVTTestCases** shortcut that was created during the installation process.

    * Alternatively, open the **%SystemDrive%\\MicrosoftProtocolTests\\FileServer\\ServerEndpoint\\&lt;version#&gt;\Batch\\** directory and double-click the **Workgroup_RunBVTTestCases.cmd** file.

2. To run the **BVT** test cases in a **DOMAIN** environment:

    * From the desktop of the Driver computer, double-click the **Run FileServer ServerDomain_BVTTestCases** shortcut that was created during the installation process.

    * Alternatively, open the **%SystemDrive%\\MicrosoftProtocolTests\\FileServer\\ServerEndpoint\\&lt;version#&gt;\Batch\\** directory and double-click the **Domain_RunBVTTestCases.cmd** file.

#### <a name="7.3.2"/> 7.3.2 Run All Test Cases

Perform the steps that follow to run all test cases in either the WORKGROUP or DOMAIN environment, as required:

1. To run all test cases in a **WORKGROUP** environment:

    * From the desktop of the Driver computer, double-click the **Run FileServer ServerWorkgroup_AllTestCases** shortcut that was created during the installation process.

    * Alternatively, open the **%SystemDrive%\\MicrosoftProtocolTests\\FileServer\\ServerEndpoint\\&lt;version#&gt;\\Batch\\** directory and double-click the **Workgroup_RunAllTestCases.cmd** file.

    ![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

    If you run all core/preconfigured test cases and your environment does not support certain features, you will see errors in the command console and in the PTM with respect to methods that failed when attempting to test those features.

2. To run test cases with the RunTestCasesByCategory.cmd script, do the following:

    * From the desktop of the Driver computer, double-click the **RunTestCasesByCategory** shortcut.

    ![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

    To run a specific group of test cases that are categorized by feature names, input the name of the appropriate test categories that are listed in the command console that appears when you run the **RunTestCasesByCategory.cmd** script.

3. To run all test cases in a **DOMAIN** environment:

    * From the desktop of the Driver computer, double-click the **Run FileServer ServerDomain_AllTestCases** shortcut that was created during the installation process.

    * Alternatively, open the **%SystemDrive%\\MicrosoftProtocolTests\\FileServer\\ServerEndpoint\\&lt;version#&gt;\\Batch\\** directory and double-click the **Domain_RunAllTestCases.cmd** file.

### <a name="7.4"/> 7.4 Reviewing Test Results

The **File Server Protocol Family Test Suite** generates test result files in different file paths, depending on the manner in which test cases were executed. For example, when running test cases from the following sources, results are saved in the specified locations:

* **Batch scripts (.cmd)** − results are saved in this location: **%SystemDrive%\\MicrosoftProtocolTests\\FileServer\\ServerEndpoint\\&lt;version#&gt;\\Batch\\TestResults\\**

* **Protocol Test Manager** − results are saved in this location: **%SystemDrive%\\MicrosoftProtocolTests\\FileServer\\Server-Endpoint\\&lt;version#&gt;\\TestResults\\**

When your tests are complete, you can review the results in the respective locations as cited above.

**More Information**

For further information about the meaning of logging in the **Protocol Test Framework** (**PTF**), please see the [PTF User Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/protocoltestframework) on **GitHub**.

You can also review test results in the following ways:

* In terms of tests that **Passed**, **Failed**, or were **Inconclusive**.

* Selecting how results are grouped: by test **Category** or by **Outcome**

* Assessment of logged data in the **StandardOutput**, **ErrorStackTrace**, and **ErrorMessage** categories.

![](./image/FileServerUserGuide/image1.png)**Note**

The StandardOutput data can also be displayed separately in HTML format.
