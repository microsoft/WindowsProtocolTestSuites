### <a name="_Toc474756926"/>Configuring the Test Suite

This test suite is installed with default configuration settings. You may need to change these settings if you use a customized test environment or if you customize your test runs. 

You can define various required and optional settings for the test suite, such as the following:

* Define the settings of the test environment, including computer names and IP addresses.

* Define the basic options used in the test suite; for example, specify if the client computer operating system platform is Windows or Non-Windows.

* Define the folders used to store output and logs from test runs.

* Define the location of scripts to run before each test run.

* Set time limits on discrete test tasks and for test runs.

To change configuration settings for this suite, edit the MS-ADOD_ODTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig file. You can find this file in the directory %systemdrive%\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADOD\OD-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Bin.

#### <a name="_Toc474756929"/>Protocol Test Manager
The configuration files can be not only changed manually, but also can be changed by using a UI tool named Protocol Test Manager (PTM). Please go to [Using Protocol Test Manager](#_Using_Protocol_Test) to see the detailed information.

## <a name="_Toc474756930"/>Running Test Cases

This test suite includes command files that you can use to complete basic test cases. Each test case verifies the protocol implementation based on a given scenario. 

A common pattern for the test scenarios is as follows:

* Ensure the remote session successfully established between PDC computer and the client computer.

* Initialize the test case on the PDC computer.

* Initialize the status of the client computer.

* Trigger the test case on the client computer.

* Verify test case results using client and PDC computer status.

* Verify message sequences in the Network Monitor capture files.

* Complete post-test cleanup. 

You can find and run these test cases in the following directory: 

%systemdrive%\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADOD\OD-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Batch

### <a name="_Toc474756931"/>Run All Test Cases

Use the steps below to run all test cases. Shortcuts listed are created during the installation process.

###To run all test cases###

* From the desktop of the PDC computer, double-click the **Run MS-ADOD-OD EP Test Cases** shortcut. 

* Alternatively, go to %systemdrive%\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADOD\OD-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch and double-click the **RunAllTestCases.cmd** file. 

### <a name="_Toc474756932"/>Run Specified Test Cases

Use the steps below to run specific test cases.

###To run specified test cases###

* From the directory %systemdrive%\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADOD\OD-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch, double-click the batch file for the test case that you want to run.

### <a name="_Toc474756933"/>Check Test Results
The handling of test results involves both the review of log files and the management of their generation. This section describes those topics.

#### <a name="_Toc474756934"/>Review the Test Log Files

By default, the test suite creates log files in the **TestResults** directory, a subfolder of Batch folder in the test suite installation directory. The log files that contain test suite results use a  &#42; **.trx** file name, in which the asterisk (“ &#42; ”) character represents the user name, the test case name, or both.

Additional log files are used for requirement coverage information and identification of test issues. Their settings are located in the  &#42; **.ptfconfig** or  &#42; **.deployment.ptfconfig** files. You can set the file names, paths, and formats in the Sinks node of the configuration file. 

The following instruction provides an example of how to prevent log entries for the "Debug" logging sink from being written into the MS-ADOD_Log.xml file in the current directory:
 
 &#60; File id="ReqLog" directory=".\" file="MS-ADOD_Log.xml" format="xml"/ &#62; 

#### <a name="_Toc474756935"/>Review the PowerShell Log Files
PowerShell log file locations are set to use the **PDCLogPath** value in the  &#42; **.deployment.ptfconfig** configuration file. The log files that contain PowerShell runtime logs use the  &#60; testcase &#35;  &#62; **.log** naming convention.

#### <a name="_Toc474756936"/>Manage the Generation of Log Files

The log files contain a range of information including, but not limited to, the following:

* Test computer client and server names

* Internet Protocol (IP) addresses

* User names and passwords

* Domain names and test domain names

* User account settings associated with Windows Active Directory

**Note** This information is not sent to Microsoft. 

If you do not need the log files for debugging, you can delete them. You can also control the generation of all log files for the test suite, except for test result ( &#42; .trx) files. 

The following describes how to stop the generation of log files using the file name extensions of .txt and .xml. This process should be followed _before_ you run test cases in Visual Studio.

###To prevent the generation of .txt and .xml type log files###

![image2.png](./image/MS-ADOD_ODUserGuide/image2.png)
Note 

This procedure assumes that the test suite was installed at the **C:** root directory. MS- ADOD represents the protocol name.

* Open the MS-ADOD _ODTestSuite.ptfconfig file. You can find this configuration file at the path %systemdrive%\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADOD\OD-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Source\OD\TestCode\TestSuite. Or, if you use batch files to run your test cases, you can find this file at %systemdrive%\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-ADOD\OD-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Bin.

* Locate the Sinks node and comment out all the entries.

* Locate the Profile node and comment out all the entries.

* Locate the Profile node and add the following entries:

&#60; Rule kind="CheckSucceeded" sink="Console" delete="false" / &#62; 
&#60; Rule kind="Comment" sink="FileLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
&#60; Rule kind="Debug" sink="FileLog" delete="false" / &#62; 
&#60; Rule kind="Checkpoint" sink="ReqLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
&#60; Rule kind="Comment" sink="ReqLog" delete="false"/ &#62; 
&#60; Rule kind="Checkpoint" sink="Beacon" delete="false"/ &#62;    

For further information about logging in the Protocol Test Framework (PTF), see the _PTF User Guide_ in the PTF installation directory.

## <a name="_Toc474756937"/>Debugging Test Cases

Clone or download the WindowsProtocolTestSuites from [https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites/), save and extract to PDC local directory, open the test suite ..\WindowsProtocolTestSuites\TestSuites\MS-AZOD\src\MS-AZOD_OD.sln with visual studio 2017.
