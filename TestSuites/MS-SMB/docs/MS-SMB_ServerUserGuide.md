* Install DFS management, create a standalone namespace "DFSNamespace".
* Create a NTFS disk.
* Create a FAT disk (Default disk is NTFS disk, if the Server OS already has a FAT disk, please skip this step).
* Create directories and files on the NTFS disk to be shared and used by the MS-SMB test suite:
	* Create two folders named "Sharefolder1" and "Sharefolder2" under the shared root directory which was created as a NTFS disk
	* Set folders "Sharefolder1" and "Sharefolder2" share property to "Everyone" and grant "Read/Write" permission
	* Create a .txt file named "ExistTest.txt" with any content at the root of "Sharefolder1" and "Sharefolder2"
	* Create one folder named "QuotaShare" under the shared root directory which was created as a NTFS disk 
	* Set folder "QuotaShare" share property to local and domain (ignore this if it's a workgroup environment) "Guest" user and grant "Full Control" permission
* Create directories and files on the FAT disk to be shared and used by the MS-SMB test suite:
	* Create two folders named "Sharefolder3" and "Sharefolder4" under the shared root directory which was created as a FAT disk.
	* Set folders "Sharefolder3" and "Sharefolder4" share property to "Everyone" and grant "Read/Write" permission
* Create a shadow copy for the NTFS disk and then change content of "ExistTest.txt" under the folders "Sharefolder1" and "Sharefolder2". Make sure "ExistTest.txt" has a previous version.
* Create a physically nonexistent printer and select the printer's model as "Brother Color Type3 Class Driver", share this printer with share name "SMBPrinter".

## <a name="7.3"/>Configuring the Test Suite

This test suite is installed with default configuration settings. You may need to change these settings if you use a customized test environment or if you customize your test runs. 
You can configure the test suite for various purposes including, for example, to:

* Define the settings of the test environment, including computer names and IP addresses.
* Define the basic options used in the test suite, for example, the protocol version or the version of the target operating system.
* Define the folders and formats used for output from test runs.
* Define scripts to run before and after each test run.
* Set time limits on discrete test tasks and for test runs.

To change configuration settings, edit the MS-SMB_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig file. You can find this file in the directory C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMB\Server-Endpoint\<version#>\\Bin.

## <a name="8"/>Running Test Cases

This test suite includes command files that you can use to complete some basic test cases. Each test case verifies the protocol implementation based on a given scenario. 
You can find and run these test cases in the following directory: 

	C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMB\Server-Endpoint\<version#>\Batch
	
You can run these command files at the command prompt, or by selecting and clicking one or more of the files from the directory.
For test environments that are not Windows based 
Before you run test cases, be sure to complete the following tasks: 

* Implement all the features that are listed in C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\MS-SMB\Server-Endpoint\<version#>\Bin\NonWindows\
