| Operating system| Any version of Windows or a SUT implementation that is not based on the Windows operating system | 
| Memory| 1 GB RAM| 
| Disk space| 60 GB| 

### <a name="_Toc396908228"/>Domain Controller (DC)

The minimum requirements for the DC are as follows.

![image2.png](./image/RDP_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)
Note 

>DC is optional. Workgroup environments do not require a domain controller.

|  **Requirement**|  **Description**| 
| -------------| ------------- |

| Memory| 1 GB RAM| 
| Disk space| 60 GB| 

### <a name="_Toc396908229"/>Software 
All of the following software must be installed on the driver computer _before_ the installation of this test suite. 

**Required Software**

All common softwares listed in [prerequisites](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites#prerequisites) for running Windows Protocol Test Suites.

**Optional Software**

* **Protocol Test Manager**

    **Protocol Test Manager** provides a graphical user interface (UI) to facilitate configuration and execution of Microsoft® Windows Protocol Test Suite tests. Its use is highly recommended.

* **Microsoft® Message Analyzer**

    **Microsoft® Message Analyzer** (MMA) is listed here as an optional tool because the test cases of themselves neither perform live captures or capture verifications during execution. However, MMA can be helpful with debugging test case results, by analyzing ETL files that are generated by the Test Cases, that is, if you enable the the Automatic Network Capturing feature in the Protocol Test Manager (PTM) during test case configuration. The Automatic Network Capturing feature is further described in the [PTF User Guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/ProtocolTestFramework/blob/staging/docs/PTFUserGuide.md#-automatic-network-capturing).

    ![image2.png](./image/RDP_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)Note

    You can download the latest Message Analyzer from below website [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226)

## <a name="_Toc396908230"/>Network Setup

You can run this test suite in a workgroup or domain environment using either physical or virtual machines. This section describes the test environment using physical computers. For information about configuring a virtual machine, see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/create-virtual-machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/create-virtual-machine). 

### <a name="_Toc396908231"/>Network Infrastructure

* A test network is required to connect the test computer systems

* It must consist of an isolated hub or switch

* It must not be connected to a production network or used for any other business or personal communications or operations

* It must not be connected to the internet 

* IP addresses must be assigned for a test network

* Computer names should be assigned in a test network infrastructure

* User credentials used on the system must be dedicated to the test network infrastructure

* Details including computer IP addresses, names and credentials are saved in log files

Refer to the Privacy Statement and EULA for further information.

### <a name="_Toc396908232"/>Domain Environment

The domain environment requires interactions between the following computers and server roles. Note that the domain controller, required for a domain environment, can be installed on the SUT. 

* The driver computer, which runs the test cases by sending requests over the wire in the form of protocol messages. 

* The SUT, which runs a server implementation of the protocol that is being tested. The SUT responds to the requests sent by the driver computer.

* The DC provides functionality that is required to test the protocol implementation. Specifically, the DC hosts Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

The following figure shows the domain environment. 

![image4.png](./image/RDP_ServerUserGuide/image4.png)

### <a name="_Toc396908233"/>Workgroup Environment

The workgroup environment requires interactions between the following computers:

* The driver computer, which runs the test cases by sending requests over the wire in the form of protocol messages. 

* The SUT, which runs a server implementation of the protocol that is being tested. The SUT responds to the requests that the driver computer sends.

The following figure shows the workgroup environment:

![image5.png](./image/RDP_ServerUserGuide/image5.png)

### <a name="_Toc396908234"/>Verify Connectivity from the Driver Computer

After you prepare the environment, verify the connection from the driver computer to the SUT, and between all other computers in the test environment. The following provides a general list of steps that you can use to check for connectivity between two Windows-based computers. For further information, see the administration guide for your operating system.

![image2.png](./image/RDP_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)
Note 

>Disable active firewalls in the test environment.

###To check the connection from the driver computer

* Click the **Start** button, and then click **Run**. 

* In the **Run** dialog box, type **cmd** and then click **OK**.

* At the command prompt, type **ping** followed by the hostname or IP address of the SUT, and then press **Enter**. The following example checks the connection to a SUT named "SUT01":
 
 &#62;  ping SUT01

* Repeat these steps until you confirm connectivity between all computers in the test environment.

Do not proceed with the configuration of the test suite until connectivity is confirmed. Any issues with network connectivity must be resolved before you configure the test suite.

## <a name="_Toc396908244"/>Running Test Cases

This test suite includes command files that you can use to complete some basic test cases. Each test case verifies the protocol implementation based on a given scenario. 

You can find and run all test cases in the following directories: 
 C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\RDP\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch

You can run these command files at the command prompt or via the graphical user interface.

### <a name="_Toc396908245"/>Run All Test Cases

Use the steps below to run all test cases.

To run all test cases

* From the desktop of the driver computer, double-click the **Run All Test Cases** shortcut.
Alternatively, go to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\RDP\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Batch, and double-click the **RunAllTestCases.cmd** file. 

### <a name="_Toc396908246"/>Check Test Results
Test suite generates test result files in different paths based on the way how test case is executed.
For running test case with batch: _C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\RDP\Server-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Batch\TestResults_
For running test case with Visual Studio: _C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\RDP\Server-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Source\Server\TestCode\TestResults_
For further information about test log settings, see the PTF User Guide in the PTF installation directory.

## <a name="_Toc396908247"/>Debugging Test Cases

![image2.png](./image/RDP_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)
Note 
You can get test suite source code from github [https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites)

You can use the Visual Studio solution (.sln) file included with this test suite to debug additional test cases that you create for your protocol implementation. 

![image2.png](./image/RDP_ServerUserGuide/image2.png)
Note 

Copy _RDP_ServerTestSuite.deployment.ptfconfig_ and _RDP_ServerTestSuite.ptfconfig_ from C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\RDP\Server-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Bin to C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\RDP\Server-Endpoint\ &#60; version &#35;  &#62; \Source\Server\TestCode\TestSuite and replace the original file.

To debug a test case

* On the driver computer, use Visual Studio to open the following solution file:
C:\MicrosoftProtocolTests\RDP\Server-Endpoint\ _&#60; version &#35;  &#62;_ \Source\Server\TestCode\RDP_Server.sln

* In the **Solution Explorer** window, right-click the **Solution** ‘**RDP_Server’**, and select **Build Solution**.

* Open the **Test Explorer** window in Visual Studio, select the names of the test cases that you want to debug.
