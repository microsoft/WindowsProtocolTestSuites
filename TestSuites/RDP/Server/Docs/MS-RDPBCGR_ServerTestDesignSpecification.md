## <a name="_Toc396468143"/>Technical Document Analysis

### <a name="_Toc396468144"/>Technical Document Overview
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting is designed to facilitate user interaction with a remote computer system by transferring graphics display information from the remote computer to the user and transporting input commands from the user to the remote computer, where the input commands are replayed on the remote computer. RDP also provides an extensible transport mechanism which allows specialized communication to take place between components on the user computer and components running on the remote computer.

### <a name="_Toc396468145"/>Relationship to Other Protocols 
[MS-RDPBCGR] is based on the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) T.120 series of protocols. The T.120 standard is composed of a suite of communication and application-layer protocols that enable implementers to create compatible products and services for real-time, multipoint data connections and conferencing.

The following protocols are tunneled within an [MS-RDPBCGR] static virtual channel:

* Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEMC]

* Clipboard Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPECLIP]

* Audio Output Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEA]

* Remote Programs Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPERP]

* Dynamic Channel Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEDYC]

* File System Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEFS]

* Serial Port Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPESP]

* Print Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEPC]

* Smart Card Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPESC]

### <a name="_Toc396468146"/>Protocol Operations/Messages 
There are 50 protocol data units (PDUs) described by this protocol, and they can be classified into the following message flows:

| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| ------------- |
|  **Message Flows** |  **Number of PDUs**| 
| Connection Sequence| 23| 
| Deactivation-Reactivation Sequence| 1| 
| Disconnection Sequences| 3| 
| Automatic Reconnection| 1| 
| Server Error Reporting and Status Updates| 2| 
| Static Virtual Channels| 1| 
| Keyboard and Mouse Input| 4| 
| Basic Server Output| 4| 
| Logon Notifications| 1| 
| Controlling Server Graphics Output| 2| 
| Display Update Notifications| 1| 
| Server Redirection| 2| 
| Network Characteristics Detection| 2| 
| Multitransport Bootstrapping| 2| 
| Connection Health Monitoring| 1| 

The Connection Sequence is one of the most important message flows; it exchanges client and server settings and negotiates common settings to use for the duration of the connection so that the input, graphics, and other data can be exchanged and processed between the client and server. The Connection Sequence is described in following figure (Figure 1-1). All message exchanges in this diagram are strictly sequential, except where noted in the text that follows.

Figure 1-1: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection sequence

### <a name="_Toc396468147"/>Protocol Properties

* RPCBCGR is a block protocol and is based on TCP.
* In RDPBCGR, the client and the server roles are as mentioned in the protocol document. For example, in a normal connection sequence the client sends the requests and the server responds. After the normal connection sequence, the client sends the keyboard input and the server sends basic output concurrently. 
* In the RDP connection phase, the PDUs exchanged between the client and server are tightly coupled by a sequence that makes the protocol synchronous in this phase. For example, Connection Initialization, Basic Setting Exchange, Channel Connection, and Capabilities Negotiation are synchronous. However, the Connection Finalization is asynchronous, which means there is no need for server to send out a response until a specific request is received.  And after the RDP connection is established, most of the PDUs are sent asynchronously, few of which need a response from the sender. For example, the Keyboard and Mouse Input PDUs are sent from the client and do not require any response from server. 
* RDPBCGR is dependent on protocols like X.224 and T.125. The protocol document specifies that the RDP packets are encapsulated in an X224 and TPKT header.
* MS-RDPBCGR supports external security protocols like TLS, CredSSP, and Standard RDP Security, which is specified in this protocol. 
* The client to server data is always encrypted, and the protocol supports multiple encryption levels.
* The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt the Client Random Number (32 bytes) for transmission to the server, and the RC4 algorithm is extensively used for encrypting the data. 
* In addition to encryption, RDP compresses virtual channel data and some data in PDU’s that are sent from client to server.
* ASN.1 encoding is used to encode and decode the structures.

## <a name="_Toc396468148"/>Test Method

### <a name="_Toc396468149"/>Assumptions, Scope and Constraints
**Assumptions:**

* The RDP server machine should be configurable; in order to test some specific features or requirements, the test suite will try to trigger the server to act with specific configuration settings, such as capability set support.
**Scope:**

* The protocol server endpoint (RDP server) playing the server role will be tested. For Windows, the Remote Desktop Service (TermService) is the server endpoint.
* The protocol client endpoint (RDP client) playing the client role is out of scope.
* The virtual channel is out of scope because the MS-RDPBCGR uses the I/O channel as the data transport.
* Testing X.224 and T.125 is out of scope.
* For Windows, the System Under Test (SUT) will be both Server SKUs and Client SKUs.
* External protocols are out of scope.
* Compression is out of scope.

**Constraint:**
There is no constraint for this Test Suite.

### <a name="_Toc396468150"/>Test Approach
Recommended Test Approach 
Traditional testing is chosen as the test approach in MS-RDPBCGR.
 Test Approach Comparison
Table 11 illustrates the comparison of test approaches for the MS-RDPBCGR test suite.

|  **Factor**|  **Model-Based (MBT)**|  **Traditional**|  **Best Choice**| 
| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
|  **Stateful**| After the RDP connection is established, most of the PDUs sent by both the server and the client are asynchronous; most of them do not require a response, so MBT cannot cover all PDUs in models.| Traditional Testing can handle this situation easily.| Traditional| 
|  **Simple logic**| The logic is not complex. MBT will require more initial effort and will be more difficult to maintain.| Traditional testing will be less effort.| Traditional| 
|  **Large Number of Test Cases**| Based on the newest test suite development process, the number of test cases is not expected to be too large.  But MBT may generate a lot of “garbage” test cases.| It is easy to create useful test cases with Traditional Testing. It can reduce the number of cases and the cost of sustaining.  | Traditional| 
|  **Simple combinations of parameters**| Parameter combination is not complex. The only case to be considered is the support for Capability Sets, which will be addressed with the use of configuration files.  | It is easy to cover all combinations of parameters with Traditional Testing.| Traditional| 

***Table 11 Test Approach Comparison***
Reasons for choosing Traditional Testing

* The protocol is not completely stateful.

* The logic of this protocol is simple. 

* Only 14 out of 50 PDUs in the connection/disconnection sequences are sent sequentially.

* The combinations of parameters are not complex. Capability sets are the exception, which will be addressed through the use of configuration files.

### <a name="_Toc396468164"/>Technical Dependencies/Considerations

#### <a name="_Toc396468165"/>Dependencies
There are no dependencies.

#### <a name="_Toc396468166"/>Technical Difficulties 
There are no technical difficulties.

#### <a name="_Toc396468167"/>Encryption Consideration

* When using the RDP standard security mechanism, MS-RDPBCGR messages are encrypted; however, you can turn off server-side encryption by setting the encryption level to low. 

* When using external security protocols, such as TLS and CredSSP, the MS-RDPBCGR transport is encrypted; this encryption cannot be turned off.

### <a name="_Toc396468168"/>Adapter Design

#### <a name="_Toc396468169"/>Adapter Overview
The MS-RDPBCGR Server Test Suite implements a protocol adapter. The protocol adapter is used to receive messages from the SUT and to send messages to the SUT. The protocol adapter is built upon the protocol test suite library, which is implemented with managed code. 

#### <a name="_Toc396468170"/>Technical Feasibility of Adapter Approach
The protocol adapter uses the protocol SDK library to generate protocol messages, which are sent to SUT. Protocol adapter compiler (PAC) is used in the MS-RDPBCGR protocol test suite library. The protocol adapter uses the protocol test suite library to consume protocol messages which are received from the SUT. The MS-RDPBCGR SDK library will parse and decode the received messages and send them to protocol adapter.

#### <a name="_Toc396468171"/>Adapter Abstract Level
Protocol Adapter
Protocol adapter defined tens of interfaces. These interfaces can be summarized as following:

* Send Message interfaces
	* Send interface for each client-to-server message.
* Receive Message events
	* Receive event for each server-to-client message.
* Other interfaces
	* **EstablishRDPConnection**: Establish a RDP connection with RDP Server
	* **ChannelJoinRequestAndConfirm**: Complete the channel join sequence
	* **GenerateStaticVirtualChannelTraffics**: Generate static virtual channel traffics
	* **GenerateSlowPathInputs**: Send Client Input Event PDUs with all kinds of input events
	* **GenerateFastPathInputs**: Send Client Fast-Path Input Event PDU with all kinds of input events
	* **ExpectFastpathOutputs**: Expect and verifies fast-path output events during a specific timespan
	* **ProcessAutoDetectSequence**: Process the network auto-detect sequence

## <a name="_Toc396468172"/>Test Cases Design

### <a name="_Toc396468173"/>Traditional Test Case Design 
The Traditional test approach is used to design all test cases. Currently, only BVT test cases are designed to cover main in-scope testable requirements. 
The following table shows the number of test cases for each scenario. 

| &#32;| &#32;| &#32;| &#32;| &#32; |
| -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
|  **Scenario**|  **Test cases**|  **BVT**|  **P0**|  **P1**|

| S8_HealthMonitoring| 1| 1| 1| 0| 

### <a name="_Toc396468174"/>Test Cases Description 
The test suite is a synthetic RDP client. In the following descriptions, all instances of the term “Test Suite” can be understood as the RDP client.

**Common prerequisites for all test cases:**

* The RDP service is started and listening the service port which serves the RDP server.

* The test suite knows the IP address and port number on which RDP server is listening.

**Common cleanup requirements:**

* The test suite disconnects all RDP connections if there any.

* The SUT deletes all data caches from previous RDP connections.   

The common prerequisites and cleanup requirements are not listed in any of the test cases. Only prerequisites and cleanup requirements unique to the test case are listed in the corresponding test case descriptions.
