## <a name="_Toc427051958"/>Technical Document Analysis

### <a name="_Toc427051959"/>Technical Document Overview
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting is designed to facilitate user interaction with a remote computer system by transferring graphics display information from the remote computer to the user and transporting input commands from the user to the remote computer, where the input commands are replayed on the remote computer. RDP also provides an extensible transport mechanism which allows specialized communication to take place between components on the user computer and components running on the remote computer.

### <a name="_Toc427051960"/>Relationship to Other Protocols 
[MS-RDPBCGR] is based on the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) T.120 series of protocols. The T.120 standard is composed of a suite of communication and application-layer protocols that enable implementers to create compatible products and services for real-time, multipoint data connections and conferencing.

The following protocols are tunneled within an [MS-RDPBCGR] static virtual channel:

* Multiparty Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEMC]

* Clipboard Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPECLIP]

* Audio Output Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEA]

* Remote Programs Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPERP]

* Dynamic Channel Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEDYC]

* File System Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEFS]

* Serial Port Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPESP]

* Print Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPEPC]

* Smart Card Virtual Channel Extension [MS-RDPESC]

### <a name="_Toc427051961"/>Protocol Operations/Messages 
There are 51 protocol data units (PDUs) described by this protocol, and they can be classified into the following message flows:


|  **Message Flows** |  **Number of PDUs**| 
| -------------| ------------- |
| Connection Sequence| 23| 
| Deactivation-Reactivation Sequence| 1| 
| Disconnection Sequences| 3| 
| Automatic Reconnection| 1| 
| Server Error Reporting and Status Updates| 2| 
| Static Virtual Channels| 1| 
| Keyboard and Mouse Input| 4| 
| Basic Output| 4| 
| Logon and Authorization Notifications| 2| 
| Controlling Server Graphics Output| 2| 
| Display Update Notifications| 1| 
| Server Redirection| 2| 
| Network Characteristics Detection| 2| 
| Multitransport Characteristics Detection| 2| 
| Connection Health Monitoring| 1| 

The Connection Sequence is one of the most important message flows; it exchanges client and server settings and negotiates common settings to use for the duration of the connection so that the input, graphics, and other data can be exchanged and processed between the client and server. The Connection Sequence is described in following figure (Figure 1\-1). All message exchanges in this diagram are strictly sequential, except where noted in the text that follows.

Figure 1\-1: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection sequence

### <a name="_Toc427051962"/>Protocol Properties
* RPCBCGR is a block protocol and is based on TCP.

* In RDPBCGR, the client and the server roles are as mentioned in the protocol document. For example, in a normal connection sequence the client sends the requests and the server responds. After the normal connection sequence, the client sends the keyboard input and the server sends basic output concurrently. 

* In the RDP connection phase, the PDUs exchanged between the client and server are tightly coupled by a sequence that makes the protocol synchronous in this phase. For example, Connection Initialization, Basic Setting Exchange, Channel Connection, and Capabilities Negotiation are synchronous. However, the Connection Finalization is asynchronous, which means there is no need for server to send out a response until a specific request is received.  And after the RDP connection is established, most of the PDUs are sent asynchronously, few of which need a response from the sender. For example, the Keyboard and Mouse Input PDUs are sent from the client and do not require any response from server. 

* RDPBCGR is dependent on protocols like X.224 and T.125. The protocol document specifies that the RDP packets are encapsulated in an X224 and TPKT header.

* MS-RDPBCGR supports external security protocols like TLS, CredSSP, and Standard RDP Security, which is specified in this protocol. 

* The client to server data is always encrypted, and the protocol supports multiple encryption levels.

* The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt the Client Random Number (32 bytes) for transmission to the server, and the RC4 algorithm is extensively used for encrypting the data. 

* In addition to encryption, RDP compresses virtual channel data and some data in PDU’s that are sent from client to server.

* ASN.1 encoding is used to encode and decode the structures.

## <a name="_Toc427051963"/>Test Method

### <a name="_Toc427051964"/>Assumptions, Scope and Constraints
**Assumptions:**

The RDP client machine should be configurable; in order to test some specific features or requirements, the test suite will try to trigger the client to act with specific configuration settings, such as capability set support.

**Scope:**

* The protocol client endpoint (RDP client) playing the client role will be tested. For Windows, the Remote Desktop Client (MSTSC.exe) is the client endpoint.
* The protocol server endpoint (RDP Server) playing the server role is out of scope.
* The virtual channel is out of scope because the MS-RDPBCGR uses the I/O channel as the data transport.
* Testing X.224 and T.125 is out of scope.
* For Windows, the System Under Test (SUT) will be Server SKUs only.
* External protocols are out of scope.
* Compression is out of scope.

**Constraint:**

There is no constraint for this Test Suite.

### <a name="_Toc427051965"/>Test Approach
**Recommended Test Approach** 

Traditional testing is chosen as the test approach in MS-RDPBCGR.

**Test Approach Comparison**
 
Table 1-1 illustrates the comparison of test approaches for the MS-RDPBCGR test suite.

|  **Factor**|  **Model-Based (MBT)**|  **Traditional**|  **Best Choice**| 
| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
|  **Stateful**| After the RDP connection is established, most of the PDUs sent by both the server and the client are asynchronous; most of them do not require a response, so MBT cannot cover all PDUs in models.| Traditional Testing can handle this situation easily.| Traditional| 
|  **Simple logic**| The logic is not complex. MBT will require more initial effort and will be more difficult to maintain.| Traditional testing will be less effort.| Traditional| 
|  **Large Number of Test Cases**| Based on the newest test suite development process, the number of test cases is not expected to be too large.  But MBT may generate a lot of “garbage” test cases.| It is easy to create useful test cases with Traditional Testing. It can reduce the number of cases and the cost of sustaining.  | Traditional| 
|  **Simple combinations of parameters**| Parameter combination is not complex. The only case to be considered is the support for Capability Sets, which will be addressed with the use of configuration files.  | It is easy to cover all combinations of parameters with Traditional Testing.| Traditional| 

***Table 1-1 Test Approach Comparison***

Reasons for choosing Traditional Testing

* The protocol is not completely stateful.

* The logic of this protocol is simple. 

* Only 14 out of 44 PDUs in the connection/disconnection sequences are sent sequentially.

* The combinations of parameters are not complex. Capability sets are the exception, which will be addressed through the use of configuration files.

### <a name="_Toc427051966"/>Test Scenarios
There are seven scenarios defined in the MS-RDPBCGR client test suite for verifying client behavior:

## <a name="_Toc427051977"/>Test Suite Design

### <a name="_Toc427051978"/>Test Suite Architecture

#### <a name="_Toc427051979"/>System under Test (SUT)
From the third party point of view, the SUT is a component that implements MS-RDPBCGR.

From the Windows implementation point of view, the SUT is the Remote Desktop Client (Mstsc.exe).

#### <a name="_Toc427051980"/>Test Suite Architecture
Figure 3\-1 illustrates the architecture of the MS-RDPBCGR test suite for client endpoint testing.

![image3.png](./image/MS-RDPBCGR_ClientTestDesignSpecification/image3.png)

 Figure 3\-1 MS-RDPBCGR Test Suite Architecture
 
As shown in Figure 3\-1, MS-RDPBCGR is using the synthetic server pattern to design the test suite architecture. The MS-RDPBCGR Test Suite contains the following components:

* The SUT Control Adapter triggers the client to send the request to the server.

* The synthetic server is the MS-RDPBCGR Test Case and the Protocol Adapter.

* The Protocol Adapter invokes the protocol SDK (Software Development Kit) to process the client messages and then sends the corresponding server response message to the client. The Protocol Adapter uses the protocol SDK to receive and parse the messages and then sends the parsed result to the relevant test case for further validation.

* TCP is the transport for test suite communication.

* The SUT is the RDP client.

* Test cases verify the protocol client behaviors specified in MS-RDPBCGR.

### <a name="_Toc427051981"/>Technical Dependencies/Considerations

#### <a name="_Toc427051982"/>Dependencies
There are no dependencies.

#### <a name="_Toc427051983"/>Technical Difficulties 
There are no technical difficulties.

#### <a name="_Toc427051984"/>Encryption Consideration

* When using the RDP standard security mechanism, MS-RDPBCGR messages are encrypted; however, you can turn off server-side encryption by setting the encryption level to low. 

* When using external security protocols, such as TLS and CredSSP, the MS-RDPBCGR transport is encrypted; this encryption cannot be turned off.

### <a name="_Toc427051985"/>Adapter Design

#### <a name="_Toc427051986"/>Adapter Overview
The MS-RDPBCGR Client Test Suite implements 2 adapters: 1 protocol adapter, and 1 SUT control adapter.

The protocol adapter is used to receive messages from the SUT and to send messages to the SUT. The protocol adapter is built upon the protocol test suite library, which is implemented with managed code. 

The SUT control adapter is used to trigger the SUT to send messages to the test suite. PowerShell scripts are provided for Windows testing. For other operating systems, you must either implement the SUT control adapter scripts or use the interactive mode to manually perform test steps.

#### <a name="_Toc427051987"/>Technical Feasibility of Adapter Approach
**Protocol Adapter**

The protocol adapter uses the protocol SDK library to generate protocol messages, which are sent to SUT. Protocol adapter compiler (PAC) is used in the MS-RDPBCGR protocol test suite library. The protocol adapter uses the protocol test suite library to consume protocol messages which are received from the SUT. The MS-RDPBCGR SDK library will parse and decode the received messages and send them to protocol adapter.

**SUT Control Adapter**

In Windows Implementation Testing, The SUT control adapter is implemented using PowerShell scripts. The PowerShell scripts remotely run the tasks created on SUT. For example, a task called Negotiate_RDPConnect is created on the SUT. The task can initiate an RDP connection using the negotiate approach. The _RDPConnectWithNegotiationAppoach_ interface is implemented by RDPConnectWithNegotiationAppoach.ps1 with content below:

_Schtasks.exe /run /s  &#60; SUT Name &#62;  /U  &#60; SUT User &#62;  /P  &#60; SUT User Password &#62;  /TN Negotiate\_RDPConnect_

#### <a name="_Toc427051988"/>Adapter Abstract Level
**Protocol Adapter**

Protocol adapter defined 33 interfaces. Most of the interfaces are directly abstracted from protocol messages, except the interfaces below:

* SetServerCapability: 

	* This interface is used to set server capabilities.

	* There are lots of parameters in capabilities. This interface helps to reduce the number of parameter combinations for the RDP connection sequence. 

* StartRDPListening

	* This interface is used to start RDP listening on server.

* StopRDPListening

	* This interface is used to stop RDP listening on server.

* EstablishRDPConnection

	* This interface is used to complete an RDP connection sequence.

	* The RDP connection sequence includes 23 messages and is used in each test case. Implementing this sequence in one interface simplifies the test case design.

* ServerInitiatedDisconnect

	* This interface is used to initiate a disconnection request from server.

	* Simplifies test case design.

* ExpectClientInitiatedDisconnect

	* This interface is used to expect a client-initiated disconnection sequence from SUT.

	* Simplifies test case design.

* DeactivateReactivate

	* This interface is used to initiate a deactivation-reactivation sequence.

	* Simplifies test case design.

**SUT Control Adapter**

The SUT control adapter defines 4 interfaces:

* _RDPConnectWithDrectTLS_: This method is used to trigger the client to initiate an RDP connection from the RDP client. The client should use Direct Approach with TLS as the security protocol.

* _RDPConnectWithDrectCredSSP_: This method is used to trigger the client to initiate an RDP connection from the RDP client, and the client should use Direct Approach with CredSSP as the security protocol.

* _RDPConnectWithNegotiationAppoach_: This method is used to trigger the client to initiate an RDP connection from the RDP client, and the client should use Negotiation-Based Approach to advertise the support for TLS, CredSSP, or RDP standard security protocol.

* _TriggerClientDisconnect_: This method is used to trigger the RDP client to initiate a disconnection of the current session.

There are two adapters defined in the MS-RDPBCGR client test suite: the protocol adapter and the SUT control adapter. The Protocol adapter uses the SUT control adapter to trigger the expected messages from SUT. The SUT control adapter returns the execution status to the protocol adapter for subsequent proceedings.

Figure 3\-1 illustrates the relationship between adapters, test cases and SUT.

### <a name="_Toc427051992"/>Test Cases Description 
The test suite is a synthetic RDP server. In the following descriptions, all instances of the term “Test Suite” can be understood as the RDP server.

**Common prerequisites for all test cases:**

* The test suite has started the TCP listening service on the port which serves the RDP server.

* The SUT knows the IP address and port number on which test suite is listening.

**Common cleanup requirements:**

* The test suite disconnects all RDP connections if there any.

* The test suite stops the TCP listening service.

* The SUT deletes all data caches from previous RDP connections.   

The common prerequisites and cleanup requirements are not listed in any of the test cases. Only prerequisites and cleanup requirements unique to the test case are listed in the corresponding test case descriptions.

To execute the test cases of S7 (Static Virtual Channel), the SUT should support the MS-RDPEFS protocol (Remote Desktop Protocol: File System Virtual Channel Extension) because this protocol is used to generate static virtual channel traffic.

To simplify the test environment of S8 (Server Redirection), the S8 test cases redirect the SUT to the same machine where the Test Suite is located. This is possible because the specific target machine is not important.
