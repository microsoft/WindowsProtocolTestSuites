## 1 Introduction

This document specifies the protocol used for Microsoft Protocol Interoperability Test Suites to remote control SUT (System under test), which runs over a TCP or UDP transport. The purpose of this protocol is to provide a protocol-based manner to control SUT. The protocol can be used to transfer SUT control command to SUT, and transfer parameters and execute result between Interoperability Test Suites and SUT. 

This document specifies the SUT Remote Control (SUTRC) Protocol. 

The SUT Remote Control Protocol is designed to provide a protocol-based manner to change or query the states of SUT when running Interoperability Test Suites. 
Sections 1.8, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative and can contain the terms MAY, SHOULD, MUST, MUST NOT, and SHOULD NOT as defined in RFC 2119. Sections 1.5 and 1.9 are also normative but cannot contain those terms. All other sections and examples in this specification are informative. 


### 1.1 Glossary

The following terms are specific to this document:

**SUT:** System under test.

**MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT:** These terms (in all caps) are used as described in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.3 Overview

SUT Remote Control protocol is used for Interoperability Test Suites to remote control SUT, this protocol provides a protocol-based manner to control SUT.  

There are two roles in this protocol: server and client.  

The protocol client is part of the Interoperability Test Suites implementation. It sends commands to server for changing or querying the SUT states. 

The protocol server runs in SUT. It listens for control commands from client side. When server receives a control command, it needs to do the operation required by client and return the operation result to the client. 

The main scenario to use SUT remote control protocol is showed as following figure. 

![image10.png](./image/image10.png)

1. Client sends **SUT Control Request Message** to Server, the message contains operations (and parameters) need to be processed on SUT.
2. Server receives **SUT Control Request Message,** and processes operations on SUT.
3. Server responds with **SUT Control Response Message** to sends result to the client.

### 1.4  Relationship to Other Protocols

None.

### 1.5  Prerequisites/Preconditions

None.

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

None.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This protocol contains no versioning and capability negotiation.

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol defined test suite ID (testsuiteId field, Section 2.2.2.1) and command ID (commandId field, Section 2.2.2.1) in each message, vendors can define their own test suite ID and command ID to extend this protocol.

Besides, all the messages contain payload field, which is used to transfer parameters or execution results. Vendors can extend this protocol by defining payload structure for each command ID their defined.

### 1.9 Standards Assignments

This protocol contains no standards assignments.

## 2   Messages

### 2.1 Transport

This protocol uses TCP or UDP as transport. All the messages and structures defined in this protocol and its extensions are encoded using little-endian format.
