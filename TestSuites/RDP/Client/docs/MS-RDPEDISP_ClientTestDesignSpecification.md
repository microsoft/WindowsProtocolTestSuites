## <a name="_Toc427063069"/>Technical Document Analysis

### <a name="_Toc427063070"/>Technical Document Overview
Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Channel Extension is an extension to the Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR] sections 1 to 5. This control protocol is used by the server to request display configuration changes in a remote session. Display configuration changes include the addition, removal and repositioning of monitors, resolution updates, and orientation updates.

### <a name="_Toc427063071"/>Relationship to Other Protocols 
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension is embedded in a dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC] sections 1 to 3. Deactivation-Reactivation Sequence as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR] section 1.3.1.3 and surface management commands specified in [MS-RDPEGFX]] section 1.3 are used to update client RDP session configuration.

### <a name="_Toc427063072"/>Protocol Operations/Messages 
There are 4 structures described by this protocol.

* DISPLAYCONTROL_HEADER 

* DISPLAYCONTROL\_CAPS_PDU

* DISPLAYCONTROL\_MONITOR\_LAYOUT_PDU

* DISPLAYCONTROL\_MONITOR_LAYOUT

The sequence of messages exchanged by the Remote Desktop Protocol: Display Control Virtual Channel Extension is described in the following figure. The messages exchanged in this diagram are strictly sequential.

### <a name="_Toc427063073"/>Protocol Properties
* RDPEDISP is a block protocol and an extension of MS-RDPBCGR.
* RDPEDISP is embedded in a RDPEDYC dynamic virtual channel transport.
* RDPEDISP operates only after the dynamic virtual channel transport is fully established. If the dynamic virtual channel transport is terminated, the RDPEDISP is also terminated.
* The protocol is terminated by closing the underlying virtual channel.

## <a name="_Toc427063074"/>Test Method

### <a name="_Toc427063075"/>Assumptions, Scope and Constraints
**Assumptions:**

* The RDP client machine should support display configuration changes. Display configuration changes include the addition, removal and repositioning of monitors, resolution updates, and orientation updates.

**Scope:**

* The protocol client endpoint (RDP client) playing the client role will be tested. For Windows, the Remote Desktop Client (MSTSC.exe) is the client endpoint.
* The protocol server endpoint (RDP Server) playing the server role is out of scope.
* For Windows, the System under Test (SUT) will be mstsc.exe.
* External protocols are out of scope.
* Compression and encryption are out of scope.

**Constraint:**

There is no constraint for this Test Suite.

### <a name="_Toc427063076"/>Test Approach
Because the MS-RDPEDISP client test code is merged into the MS-RDPBCGR test code, it applies the same test approach used for MS-RDPBCGR: traditional testing. 

For more details about the reason for choosing traditional testing, please refer to **MS-RDPBCGR_ClientTestDesignSpecificaitoin.md**.

### <a name="_Toc427063077"/>Test Scenarios
There are 4 scenarios defined in the MS-RDPEDISP client test suite for verifying the client behavior. See Table 2-1 MS-RDPEDISP Test Suite Scenarios for more information.

|  **Scenario**|  **Priority**|  **Test Approach**|  **Description**| 
| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
| S1_ResolutionChange| 0| Traditional| Verify RDPEDISP resolution updates sequence| 
| S2_OrientationChange| 0| Traditional| Verify RDPEDISP orientation updates sequence| 
| S3_MonitorAdditionRemoval| 1| Traditional| Verify RDPEDISP addition, removal of monitors sequence| 
| S4_MonitorReposition| 1| Traditional| Verify RDPEDISP repositioning of monitors sequence|

#### <a name="_Toc427063085"/>Test Suite Architecture
Figure 3-1 illustrates the architecture of the MS-RDPEDISP test suite for client endpoint testing.

![image3.png](./image/MS-RDPEDISP_ClientTestDesignSpecification/image3.png)

Figure 3-1 MS-RDPEDISP Test Suite Architecture

As shown in Figure 3-1, MS-RDPEDISP is using the synthetic server pattern to design the test suite architecture. MS-RDPEDISP Test Suite contains the following components:

* The SUT Control Adapter is used by the test case to trigger the client to send the request to the server.

* The Test suite invokes the protocol SDK (test suite library) to process the client messages and then sends the corresponding server response message to the client.

* The MS-RDPEDISP Test Suite uses RDPEDYC dynamic virtual channel as the transport to communicate with SUT.

* The SUT for the MS-RDPEDISP Test Suite is the RDP Client.

The MS-RDPEDISP Test Case will verify the protocol client behaviors specified in MS-RDPEDISP.

### <a name="_Toc427063086"/>Technical Dependencies/Considerations

#### <a name="_Toc427063087"/>Dependencies
Transport: Both TCP and UDP transport are used. The main RDP connection use TCP transport, and the RDPEDISP messages are transmitted on RDPEDYC dynamic virtual channel base on TCP or UDP transport.

#### <a name="_Toc427063088"/>Technical Difficulties 
None.

#### <a name="_Toc427063089"/>Encryption Consideration
None.

### <a name="_Toc427063092"/>Test Cases Description 
The test suite is a synthetic RDP server. In the following descriptions, all instances of the term “Test Suite” can be understood as the RDP server.

Common prerequisites for all test cases:

* The test suite has established the main RDP connection.
* The test suite has established RDPEDYC dynamic virtual channel.

Common cleanup requirements:

* The test suite disconnects all RDP connections if there any.
* The test suite stops the TCP and UDP listening service.
* The SUT deletes all data caches from previous RDP connections.   

The common prerequisites and clean requirements are not listed in any of the test cases. Only prerequisites and cleanup requirements unique to the test case are listed in the corresponding test case descriptions.
