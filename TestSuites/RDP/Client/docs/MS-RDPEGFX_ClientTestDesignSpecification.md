## <a name="_Toc427065065"/>Technical Document Analysis

### <a name="_Toc427065066"/>Technical Document Overview
The Remote Desktop Protocol: Graphics Pipeline Extension applies to the Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting, as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR]. The graphics protocol is used to efficiently encode graphics display data generated in a session associated with a remote user on a terminal server so that the data can be sent on the wire, received, decoded, and rendered by a compatible client.

The graphics protocol introduces bitmap cache and two new graphics encoding technique (ClearCodec and RemoteFX Progressive Codec) to improve the efficiency of transferring graphics bitmap data.

### <a name="_Toc427065067"/>Relationship to Other Protocols 
[MS-RDPEGFX] is embedded in the dynamic virtual channel transport, as specified in [MS-RDPEDYC]. 

[MS-RDPEGFX] can also transmit graphic bitmap data encoded by image codecs specified in [MS-RDPRFX], [MS-RDPNSC], and [MS-RDPEGDI].

### <a name="_Toc427065068"/>Protocol Operations/Messages 
This protocol describes 5 types of messages as below:

1.**Cache management** commands are used to evict entries from a bitmap cache and to notify the server of cache entries stored in a client-side persistent bitmap cache.

RDPGFX\_EVICT\_CACHE\_ENTRY_PDU 

RDPGFX\_CACHE\_IMPORT\_OFFER_PDU 

RDPGFX\_CACHE\_IMPORT\_REPLY_PDU 

2.**Surface management** commands are used to manage the lifetime of offscreen surfaces, to map offscreen surfaces to the graphics output buffer, and to adjust the dimensions of the graphics output buffer.

RDPGFX\_CREATE\_SURFACE\_PDU

RDPGFX\_DELETE\_SURFACE\_PDU

RDPGFX\_RESET\_GRAPHICS

RDPGFX\_MAP\_SURFACE\_TO\_OUTPUT_PDU

3.**Framing** commands are used to group graphics commands into logical frames and to indicate to the server that a frame has been decoded.

RDPGFX\_START\_FRAME\_PDU

RDPGFX\_END\_FRAME\_PDU

RDPGFX\_FRAME\_ACKNOWLEDGE_PDU

4.**Capability exchange** commands are used to exchange capability sets.

RDPGFX\_CAPS\_ADVERTISE_PDU

RDPGFX\_CAPS\_CONFIRM_PDU

5.**Blit** commands are used to transfer bitmaps from the server to an offscreen surface on the client, transfer bitmaps between offscreen surfaces, transfer bitmaps between offscreen surfaces and a bitmap cache, and to fill a rectangular region on an offscreen surface with a predefined color.

RDPGFX\_WIRE\_TO\_SURFACE\_PDU_1

RDPGFX\_WIRE\_TO\_SURFACE\_PDU_2

RDPGFX\_DELETE\_ENCODING_\CONTEXT\_PDU

RDPGFX\_SOLIDFILL_PDU

RDPGFX\_SURFACE\_TO\_SURFACE\_PDU

RDPGFX\_SURFACE\_TO\_CACHE_PDU

RDPGFX\_CACHE\_TO\_SURFACE\_PDU

The typical message flow of this protocol is described in following figures.

![image2.png](./image/MS-RDPEGFX_ClientTestDesignSpecification/image2.png)

_Figure 1-1: MS-RDPEGFX typical message flow_

### <a name="_Toc427065069"/>Protocol Properties
* MS-RDPEGFX is a block protocol.

* MS-RDPEGFX is an extension to MS-RDPBCGR and all packets are transmitted in dynamic virtual channels which described in MS-RDPEDYC.

* MS-RDPEGFX is a Microsoft Communication Protocol Program (MCPP) protocol.

* MS-RDPEGFX is asynchronous because most of the messages don’t need any response. 

## <a name="_Toc427065070"/>Test Method

### <a name="_Toc427065071"/>Assumptions, Scope and Constraints
**Assumptions:**

None.

**Scope:**

1. Protocol client endpoint, playing the client role, will be tested. For Windows, Terminal Client (MSTSC.exe) is the RDP client endpoint. 

2. Protocol Server endpoint, playing the server role, is out of scope for testing. 

3. The validation of the client decode behaviors if out of scope, because it cannot be observed on the wire.  

**Constraint:**

None.

### <a name="_Toc427065072"/>Test Approach
**Recommended Test Approach**

Traditional testing is chosen as the test approach in MS-RDPEGFX.

**Test Approach Comparison**

Table 11 illustrates the comparison of test approaches for the MS-RDPEGFX test suite.

|  **Factor**|  **Model-Based (MBT)**|  **Traditional**|  **Best Choice**| 
| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
|  **Stateful**| After the RDP capability exchange is done, all of the PDUs sent by both the server and the client are asynchronous; most of them do not require a response, so MBT is NOT suitable to cover all PDU combination cases in models.| Traditional Testing can handle this situation easily.| Traditional| 
|  **Simple logic**| The logic is not complex. MBT will require more initial effort and will be more difficult to maintain.| Traditional testing will be less effort.| Traditional| 
|  **Large Number of Test Cases**| Based on the newest test suite development process, the number of test cases is not expected to be too large.  But MBT may generate a lot of “garbage” test cases.| It is easy to create useful test cases with Traditional Testing. It can reduce the number of cases and the cost of sustaining.  | Traditional| 

Reasons for choosing Traditional Testing

* The protocol is not stateful.

* The logic of this protocol is simple. 

* Only 2 out of 19 PDUs in the connection/disconnection sequences are sent sequentially.

* The combinations of parameters are not complex.

### <a name="_Toc427065073"/>Test Scenarios

* There are 10 scenarios designed for MS-RDPEGFX client testing. Please refer to “Table 2-1 Scenarios of MS-RDPEGFX Test Suite” for more information.

### <a name="_Toc427065086"/>Test Suite Architecture

#### <a name="_Toc427065087"/>System under Test (SUT)
From the third party point of view, the SUT is a component which implements MS-RDPEGFX.

From the Windows implementation point of view, the SUT is the Remote Desktop Client (Mstsc.exe).

#### <a name="_Toc427065088"/>Test Suite Architecture
Figure 3-1 illustrates the architecture of the MS-RDPBCGR test suite for client endpoint testing.

![image3.png](./image/MS-RDPEGFX_ClientTestDesignSpecification/image3.png)

 _Figure 3-1 MS-RDPEGFX Test Suite Architecture_
 
As shown in Figure 31, MS-RDPEGFX is using the synthetic server pattern to design the test suite architecture. MS-RDPEGFX Test Suite contains the following components:

* The SUT Control Adapter is used by the test case to trigger the client to send the request to the server.

* The synthetic server is MS-RDPEGFX Test Case and Protocol Adapter.

* The Protocol Adapter invokes the protocol SDK (test suite library) to process the client messages and then sends the corresponding server response message to the client. Then the Protocol Adapter will use the protocol SDK to receive and parse the messages. Later the Protocol Adapter will send the parsed result to the relevant test case for further validation.

* The transport is TCP in MS-RDPEGFX Test Suite to communicate with SUT.

* The SUT for MS-RDPEGFX Test Suite is RDP Client.

MS-RDPEGFX Test Case will verify the protocol client behaviors specified in MS-RDPEGFX.

### <a name="_Toc427065089"/>Technical Dependencies/Considerations

#### <a name="_Toc427065090"/>Dependencies
None.

#### <a name="_Toc427065091"/>Technical Difficulties 
None.

#### <a name="_Toc427065092"/>Encryption Consideration
None.

### <a name="_Toc427065093"/>Adapter Design

#### <a name="_Toc427065094"/>Adapter Overview
The MS-RDPEGFX Client test suite implements one adapter: the protocol adapter of MS-RDPEGFX. It uses the SUT control adapter and the protocol adapter of MS-RDPBCGR.

The protocol adapter of MS-RDPEGFX is used to receive messages from SUT and to send out the messages to the SUT. This adapter is built upon the Protocol Test Suite Library, so it is implemented with managed code. 

For the details about the SUT control adapter and the protocol adapter of MS-RDPBCGR, please refer to **MS-RDPBCGR_ClientTestDesignSpecification.md**.

#### <a name="_Toc427065095"/>Technical Feasibility of Adapter Approach
Message Consumption:

All the protocol messages are marshaled and unmarshaled by protocol adapter. 

Protocol Adapter depends on MS-RDPEDYC test suite library to send and receive messages.

SUT Control Adapter:

MS-RDPEGFX test suite reuses the SUT control adapter of MS-RDPBCGR. Please refer to section 3.3.2 of **MS-RDPBCGR_ClientTestDesignSpecificaitoin.md** for the technical feasibility information of SUT control adapter.

#### <a name="_Toc427065096"/>Adapter Abstract Level
Protocol Adapter of MS-RDPEGFX

This protocol adapter defines 24 methods:

* **AttachDvcClient**: used to attach a dynamic virtual channel manager which can send messages to and receive messages from RDP client.

* **ProtocolInitialize**: used to initiate this protocol by creating the graphics dynamic virtual channel.

* **SetTestType**: used to switch the test type from positive test and negative tests.

* **ExpectCapabilityAdvertise**: used to receive, decode and validate capability advertise message.

* **SolidFillSurface**: used to instruct client to fill surface with solid color.

* **SendNestedFrames**: used to send a nested egfx logical frame to client.

* **CacheSurface**: used to instruct client to copy bitmap data from a source surface to the bitmap cache.

* **FillSurfaceByCachedBitmap**: used to instruct client to copy bitmap data from a source surface to the bitmap cache and copy bitmap data from the bitmap cache to a destination surface.

* **IntraSurfaceCopy**: instruct the client to replicate bitmap data within the same surface.

* **InterSurfaceCopy**: used to instruct the client to copy bitmap data from a source surface to a destination surface

* **DeleteSurface**: used to instruct client to delete a surface.

* **SendRdpegfxFrameInSegment**: used to pack rdpegfx frame into segment header and send it.

* **RemoteFXCodecEncode**: used to encode a bitmap data by RemoteFX codec.

* **SendRfxProgressiveCodecPduWithoutImage**: used to send RFX Progressive codec Pdu without image data to client.

* **RfxProgressiveCodecEncode**: used to encode bitmap data in RFX Progressive codec.

* **GetUsedRfxProgssiveCodecContextId**: used to get a used RfxProgssiveCodec context Id.

* **DeleteRfxProgssiveCodecContextId**: used to instruct the client to delete a compression context that was sent before.

* **SendImageWithClearCodec**: used to send ClearCodec encoded bitmap.

* **SendClearCodecGlyphInBatch**: used to send ClearCodec encoded glyph in batch.

* **SendImageCompress**: used to send bitmap data in compress/uncompress mode.

#### <a name="_Toc427065097"/>Adapter Inner Work
Totally 3 adapters are involved in MS-RDPEGFX client test suite. They are:

* Protocol adapter of MS-RDPBCGR

* Protocol adapter of MS-RDPEGFX

* SUT control adapter

The SUT control adapter is used to trigger client to initiate the connection to server and clean up the test environment.

Protocol adapter of MS-RDPBCGR is used to establish the RDP connection between server and client.

Protocol adapter for MS-RDPEGFX is used to send protocol messages to client and receive protocol messages from client. It also contains the main functionality of message encoding, decoding, and verification.

The three protocol adapters share the same RDP session.

Figure 3-2 illustrates the inner work flow of these four adapters.

The total BVT case number is 16, non-BVT case is 135, P2 case is 0 and the all case number is 151.

### <a name="_Toc427065100"/>Test Cases Description 
The test suite is a synthetic RDP server. In the following descriptions, all instances of the term “Test Suite” can be understood as the RDP server.

The common prerequisites for all test cases are listed below:

* Test Suite has started the TCP listening on the port which serves the RDP server.

* SUT knows the IP address and port number which test suite is listening on.

* Test Suite has created a Dynamic Virtual Channel named “Microsoft::Windows::RDS:Graphics”.

* The SUT (RDP client) side message are never segmented and RDP8.0 compressed

* The Test Suite (RDP server) side messages are packed into 1 segment and are RDP8.0 compressed by default.

The common cleanup requirements are listed below:

* Test Suite disconnects all RDP connections if any.

* Test Suite stops the TCP listening.

* SUT deletes all data caches from previous RDP connection.   

In order to keep it simple, the common prerequisites and clean requirements are not listed in any of the test cases. Only prerequisites and cleanup requirements unique to the test case are listed in the corresponding test case description.
