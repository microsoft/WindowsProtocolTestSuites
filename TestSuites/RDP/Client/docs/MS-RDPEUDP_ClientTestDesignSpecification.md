## <a name="_Toc350342265"/>Technical Document Analysis

### <a name="_Toc350342266"/>Technical Document Overview
The Remote Desktop Protocol: UDP Transport Extension Protocol has been designed to improve the performance of the network connectivity compared to a corresponding RDP-TCP connection, especially on wide area networks (WANs) or wireless networks.

It has the following two primary goals:

* Gain a higher network share while reducing the variation in packet transit delays.

* Share network resources with other users.

To achieve these goals, the protocol has two modes of operation. The first mode is a reliable mode where data is transferred reliably through persistent retransmits. The second mode is an unreliable mode, where no guarantees are made about reliability and the timeliness of data is preserved by avoiding retransmits. In addition, the Remote Desktop Protocol: UDP Transport Extension Protocol includes a forward error correction (FEC) logic that can be used to recover from random packet losses.

### <a name="_Toc350342267"/>Relationship to Other Protocols 
The Remote Desktop Protocol: UDP Transport Extension Protocol works on top of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

### <a name="_Toc350342268"/>Protocol Operations/Messages 
**Structures and Messages**

There are 7 structures described by this protocol.

* RDPUDP\_FEC_HEADER

* RDPUDP\_FEC\_PAYLOAD_HEADER 

* RDPUDP\_PAYLOAD_PREFIX 

* RDPUDP\_SOURCE\_PAYLOAD_HEADER 

* RDPUDP\_SYNDATA_PAYLOAD 

* RDPUDP\_ACK\_OF\_ACKVECTOR_HEADER 

* RDPUDP\_ACK\_OF\_ACKVECTOR_HEADER

There are 5 messages consisted of the above structures.

* SYN Datagrams

* ACK Datagrams

* SYN and ACK Datagrams

* ACK and Source Packets Data

* ACK and FEC Packets Data

**Message Flows:** 

The two endpoints, the terminal client and the terminal server, first set up a connection, and then transfer the data as shown in the following figure. 

![image2.jpeg](./image/MS-RDPEUDP_ClientTestDesignSpecification/image2.jpeg)

### <a name="_Toc350342269"/>Protocol Properties
* RDPEUDP is a block protocol and an extension of MS-RDPBCGR.

* RDPEUDP specifies network connectivity between the user's machine and a remote computer system over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

* The transport of RDPEUDP is UDP.

* RDPEUDP doesn’t have any authentication, encryption and compression methods.

## <a name="_Toc350342270"/>Test Method

### <a name="_Toc350342271"/>Assumptions, Scope and Constraints
**Assumptions:**

The RDP client machine should Support using RDP-UDP transport.

**Scope:**

* The protocol client endpoint (RDP client) playing the client role will be tested. For Windows, the Remote Desktop Client (MSTSC.exe) is the client endpoint.

* The protocol server endpoint (RDP Server) playing the server role is out of scope.

* For Windows, the System under Test (SUT) will be mstsc.exe.

* External protocols are out of scope.

* Compression and encryption are out of scope.

**Constraint:**

There is no constraint for this Test Suite.

### <a name="_Toc350342272"/>Test Approach
Because the MS-RDPEUDP client test code is merged into the MS-RDPBCGR test code, it applies the same test approach used for MS-RDPBCGR: traditional testing. 

For more details about the reason for choosing traditional testing, please refer to MS-RDPBCGR_ClientTestDesignSpecificaitoin.docx.

### <a name="_Toc350342273"/>Test Scenarios
There are 2 scenarios defined in the MS-RDPEUDP client test suite for verifying the client behavior. See Table 2-1 MS-RDPEUDP Test Suite Scenarios for more information.

|  **Scenario**|  **Priority**|  **Test Approach**|  **Description**| 
| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
| S1_Connection| 0| Traditional| Verify the RDP-UDP connection phase and keep alive behavior.| 
| S2_DataTransfer| 0| Traditional| Verify data transfer over RDP-UDP connection.| 

_Table 2-1 MS-RDPEUDP Test Suite Scenarios_

#### <a name="_Toc350342274"/>S1_Connection
**Preconditions:**

* The RDP connection has been established.

**Typical Sequence:**

The typical scenario sequence is the following:

* RDP server sends a Server Initiate Multitransport Request PDU through main RDP connection (described in MS-RDPBCGR).

* RDP Client establish a UDP connection with the RDP server

* RDP client sends a SYN datagram over UDP connection.

* RDP server responds a SYN and ACK datagram over UDP connection.

* RDP client responds an ACK and source packet datagram over UDP connection.

**Scenario Testing:**

This scenario will test the following messages:

* SYN datagram

* SYN and ACK datagram

#### <a name="_Toc350342275"/>S2_DataTransfer
**Preconditions:**

* The RDP connection has been established.

**Typical Sequence:**

The typical scenario sequence is the following:

* RDP server and RDP client establish a RDP-UDP connection.

* RDP server sends ACK and source packets over RDP-UDP connection

* RDP client send ACK or ACK and source packets to acknowledge the receipt of these source packets.

**Scenario Testing:**

This scenario will test the following messages:

* ACK datagram

* ACK and Source datagram

## <a name="_Toc350342276"/>Test Suite Design

### <a name="_Toc350342277"/>Test Suite Architecture

#### <a name="_Toc350342278"/>System under Test (SUT)
* From the third party point of view, the SUT is a component which implements MS-RDPEUDP.

* From the Windows implementation point of view, the SUT is the Remote Desktop Client (Mstsc.exe).

#### <a name="_Toc350342279"/>Test Suite Architecture
Figure 3-1 illustrates the architecture of the MS-RDPEUDP test suite for client endpoint testing.

![image3.png](./image/MS-RDPEUDP_ClientTestDesignSpecification/image3.png)

 _Figure 3-1 MS-RDPEUDP Test Suite Architecture_
 
As shown in Figure 3-1, MS-RDPEUDP is using the synthetic server pattern to design the test suite architecture. MS-RDPEUDP Test Suite contains the following components:

* The SUT Control Adapter is used by the test case to trigger the client to send the request to the server.

* The synthetic server is the MS-RDPEUDP Test Case.

* The Test suite invokes the protocol SDK (test suite library) to process the client messages and then sends the corresponding server response message to the client.

* The MS-RDPEUDP Test Suite uses both TCP and UDP as the transport to communicate with SUT.

* The SUT for the MS-RDPEUDP Test Suite is the RDP Client.

The MS-RDPEUDP Test Case will verify the protocol client behaviors specified in MS-RDPEUDP.

### <a name="_Toc350342280"/>Technical Dependencies/Considerations

#### <a name="_Toc350342281"/>Dependencies
Transport: Both TCP and UDP transport are used. The main RDP connection use TCP transport and the RDPEUDP messages are transmitted on UDP transport.

#### <a name="_Toc350342282"/>Technical Difficulties 
None.

#### <a name="_Toc350342283"/>Encryption Consideration
None.

## <a name="_Toc350342284"/>Test Cases Design

### <a name="_Toc350342285"/>Traditional Test Case Design 
The Traditional test approach is used to design all test cases. The test cases are designed to cover all in-scope testable requirements, including both positive and negative requirements. 

The following table shows the number of test cases for each scenario. 

|  **Scenario**|  **Test Cases**|  **BVTs**|  **P0**|  **P1**|  **P2**| 
| -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------| ------------- |
| S1_Connection| 2| 1| 1| 1| 0| 
| S2_DataTransfer| 8| 5| 5| 2| 1| 

### <a name="_Toc350342286"/>Test Cases Description 
The test suite is a synthetic RDP server. In the following descriptions, all instances of the term “Test Suite” can be understood as the RDP server.

**Common prerequisites for all test cases:**

* The test suite has established main RDP connection.

* The test suite has started the UDP listening service on the port which serves the RDP server.

**Common cleanup requirements:**

* The test suite disconnects all RDP connections if there any.

* The test suite stops the TCP and UDP listening service.

* The SUT deletes all data caches from previous RDP connections.   

The common prerequisites and clean requirements are not listed in any of the test cases. Only prerequisites and cleanup requirements unique to the test case are listed in the corresponding test case descriptions.
