    <h2 class="text-center">Image Quality Assessment Algorithms</h2>
    <p>
        Image quality assessment (IQA) plays an important role in various image processing applications.
         IQA is used to provide image quality assessment between the images before encoding and the
         images after decoding. Serveral Algorithms are implemented in the RDP test suite. In this tool
         MSE (Mean Square Error), PSNR (Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index
         Mesaurement), MSSSIM (Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index Mesaurement), GSSIM (Gradient
         Structural Similarity Index Mesaurement) are provided. Some samples can be found <a href="#samples">here</a>.

        <dt>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</dt>
        <dd>In statistics, the mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator measures the average of the
             squares of the "errors", that is, the difference between the estimator and what is estimated.
             MSE is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss or
             quadratic loss. The difference occurs because of randomness or because the estimator doesn't
             account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate. Details refer to

    <dl style="padding: 10px">
        <dt>Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)</dt>
        <dd>Peak signal-to-noise ratio, often abbreviated PSNR, is an engineering term for the ratio
             between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise that
             affects the fidelity of its representation. Because many signals have a very wide dynamic
             range, PSNR is usually expressed in terms of the logarithmic decibel scale. Details refer to 
             @Html.ActionLink("here", "Index", "IQAPSNR").

    </dl>

    <dl style="padding: 10px">
        <dt>Structural SIMilarity (SSIM)</dt>
        <dd>The structural similarity (SSIM) index is a method for measuring the similarity between two images.
             The SSIM index is a full reference metric; in other words, the measuring of image quality based on
             an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference. SSIM is designed to improve on
             traditional methods like peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE), which
             have proven to be inconsistent with human eye perception. Details refer to 
             @Html.ActionLink("here", "Index", "IQASSIM").
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl style="padding: 10px">
        <dt>Multi-Scale Structural SIMilarity (MS-SSIM)</dt>
        <dd>Multi-Scale Structural SIMilarity (MS-SSIM) is layered on SSIM. The algorithm calculates multiple SSIM
             values at multiple image scales (resolutions). By running the algorithm at different scales,
             the quality of the image is evaluated for different viewing distances. MS-SSIM also puts less
             emphasis on the luminance component compared to the contrast and structure components. In
             total, MS-SSIM has been shown to increase the correlation between the MS-SSIM index and
             subjective quality tests. However, the trade-off is that MS-SSIM takes a few times longer
             to run than the straight SSIM algorithm. Details refer to 
             @Html.ActionLink("here", "Index", "IQAMSSSIM").
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl style="padding: 10px">
        <dt>Gradient based Structural SIMilarity (G-SSIM)</dt>
        <dd>Gradient based Structural SIMilarity (G-SSIM) leverages the assumption that the edge information as
             the most important image structure information. It is a supplement for SSIM because SSIM is found
             failed in measuring badly blurred images. It makes sense because many researchers' studying results
             find that human eye is very sensitive to the edge and contour information of an image, that is, the
             edge and contour information may be the most important information of an image's structure for human
             to 'capture' the scene. Details refer to

        The following four images are some images generated by several implementations of RemoteFX
         Codec Algorithms in a real scenario. Figure 1 is the original image before encoding. Figure
         2 is the decoded image by RemoteFX Codec and it reduces some high frequency part. Figure 3 
         shows an image which severely loses high frequency. An incorrectly decoded images is shown
         by Figure 4.
