			<h2>RDP Protocol Tool Set</h2>
            <p>
                RDP Protocol Tool Set is a set of tools developed for RDP protocol testing. It contains RDP Codec Tool and 
				Image Comparison tool. The tool set is developed by Microsoft Protocol Test Suite Development team located in Shanghai. Microsoft Protocol Test Suite Development team
				targets at developing test suite and improve the quality of Microsoft Open Specifications.
            </p>
            <h4>RDP Codec Tool</h4>
            <p>
                One of the core requirements of desktop remoting is the ability to efficiently compress server-side screen images
                     so that they can be transported over a network and displayed on a client screen. Any codec used for this purpose
                     needs to be able to deliver effective compression (to reduce network bandwidth requirements) and operate with
                     low-latency (to enable efficient interactions with remoted content). RDP Codec Tool targets at demonstrating
                     the encode and decode of these codec algorithm and helping programmers debug their own implementations.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Image Comparison Algorithms</h4>
            <p>
                Image quality assessment (IQA) plays an important role in various image processing applications. IQA is used to provide
                    image quality assessment between the images before encoding and the images after decoding. Serveral Algorithms are
                    implemented in the RDP test suite. In this tool MSE (Mean Square Error), PSNR (Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural
                    Similarity Index Mesaurement), MSSSIM (Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index Mesaurement), GSSIM (Gradient Structural
                    Similarity Index Mesaurement) are provided.
