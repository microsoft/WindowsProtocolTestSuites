## Coding Style
The basic rule is following the coding style of the existing code. 

## Test
Every time you make changes to Protocol SDK, you must run **buildall.cmd** to make sure the change you made will not effect other test suites.

Every time you make changes to a Test Suite, you must run all the impacted cases of the test suite and make sure they can all pass and be compatible with Windows.

## Documentation
If a new test case is added to a test suite, the corresponding test design spec must be updated.

If a new configuration is added to a test suite, the corresponding user guide must be updated.
