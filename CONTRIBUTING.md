	* Submit updates and improvements to the documentation like User Guide and Test Design Specification.
	* Contribute to existing bug fixes.

## Pull Request
Before you send out the pull request, you must:

* Run all the impacted cases of the test suite and make sure that they all pass and are compatible with Windows.

Your pull request should:

* Include a description of what your change intends to do. Have clear commit messages, e.g. "Add feature", "Fix issue", "Add test cases for protocol"
* Follow the code conventions of the existing code.
* Include the update to the specific document if you add new cases or new configurations.
	* If a new test case is added to a test suite, the corresponding test design specification must be updated.
	* If a new configuration is added to a test suite, the corresponding user guide must be updated.

After we receive the pull request, we will do code review and give you feedback.
